1,implemented,"[Mobile][Your Library] ""Spotify Playlists"" folder",Peter,"Idea: Create a separate folder in Your Library (similar to Your Episodes for podcasts - see screenshot) where all your Spotify editorial playlists are saved when liked. Use case: I'm a heavy mobile app user and I have liked countless numbers of Spotify playlists, but I don't have an easy way of finding and organising them. Instead of users having to do so manually, Spotify could create a separate directory where, every time I like a Spotify playlist, it is automatically saved under it. It could simply be called ""Spotify Playlists"". Currently (as of Spotify for Android version 8.6.88.1104), you can go to Your Library, filter by Playlists and sort by Creator, and scroll down to S to see a list of your saved Spotify playlists. However, the advantage of having a separate directory (in addition to ease of use) is that it would be able to have additional features and sorting capability (e.g. by genre/mood, similar to Liked Songs).",08:52 AM,‎2022-01-04,,102,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Mobile-Your-Library-quot-Spotify-Playlists-quot-folder/idi-p/5322875?search-action-id=342735444271&search-result-uid=5322875,en

15,implemented,[Desktop] Put the Liked Songs back under each band's/artist's page for the desktop app,LokiX21,"Not sure why it was even changed in the first place, but yeah... the new user interface for the desktop app is really inefficient, frustrating, and ultimately a deal breaker in its altering how the songs that you've liked are accessed.More specifically... taking them off of each individual band's/artist's page where it previously only took a few seconds to find and play a song that you liked through the green heart mechanism was a bad idea/move.Furthermore... throwing them all together into a single play list is an even worse idea/move given that it now takes so long trying to scroll up and down through thousands of liked songs while trying to find whatever it is you're specifically looking for that you are better off just giving up trying to use the desktop app and switching over to the mobile/tablet Spotify app that still has your liked songs listed under the artist page, or just straight up ditching Spotify completely and looking up the song on YouTube, Bandcamp, etc.With that... and as someone who has ever-present tinnitus in both ears from my time serving in the military that in turn makes being able to use the Spotify desktop app to listen to music through headphones that are of high-enough quality to actually be capable of drowning out the constant ringing in my ears (and in turn desktop-dependent) super important in maintaining my sanity/mental health...I damn near beg whoever is in charge of such to re-implement the layout of the previous user interface so that the Liked Songs are moved back to the individual Artist's page as its removal with the new user interface has pretty much killed off my being able to even use the new Spotify desktop app at all (and in turn the aforementioned high quality headphones that I am dependent upon).Additionally... might I add that putting the ""About"" section of each artist's page at the very bottom instead of at the very top of it is also a bad move in that having actual info about the artist listed as the very last thing on their page is really inefficient (if not disrespectful) given that it comes after other artist's work is recommended before you can even read about the artist whose page you clicked on to check out in the first place.With that... I'd not only recommend returning the Liked Songs to each Artist's page, but also recommend structuring their pages so that it is presented in the following and more efficient order...1) the About section;2) the Liked Songs section;3) the Popular songs section;4) the Discography section;5) the Offers section;6) the Artist Playlists section;7) the Featuring section;😎 the Fans also like section.I hope that whatever powers that be within the Spotify decision-making hierarchy that actually see this seriously consider, and really... just start straight up making moves to get the ball rolling on having at least the Like Songs (re)implemented to each Artist page, because if not... people such as myself that are a heavy, heavy users of the desktop app are highly likely to start transitioning to some other means of efficiently listening to the music that they love, which is something that I really hope I don't have to do after having already invested hundreds (if not thousands) of hours into piecing together a music library that serves as a key (if not primary) component of maintaining my sanity/mental health.Sincerely,L",03:14 AM,‎2021-04-04,,175,30,3,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Desktop-Put-the-Liked-Songs-back-under-each-band-s-artist-s-page/idi-p/5181258?search-action-id=342735444271&search-result-uid=5181258,en
16,implemented,[Desktop][Playlists] Paste Songs in Playlist at Specific Point,brayden1121,With the new UI update the ability to paste songs at a certain point in a playlist seems to be missing. I have some pretty long playlists that I use custom ordering with. Having the ability to paste songs I recently added to it at a certain point was really helpful. This allowed me to highlight a song near where I wanted the new songs to go and when I pasted the cut songs would be pasted right below it. This saved a lot of time because I didn't need to drag songs from the bottom of the playlist after they were added through the playlist for minutes at a time. This was a great feature and I hope something to replace it or the feature is reinstated. It appears that right now when I try to do this the songs are pasted at the end of the playlist. I have not found a new feature or workaround to this at the moment. This idea implies the existence of the ability to cut rather than just copy songs in a playlist as well so I didn't feel the need to create a separate idea post for that feature. This also doesn't have to be exactly as I described it. A way to move songs to a certain point in a playlist in any way is just what I am looking for. I know the UI is brand new so these are probably just the growing pains but I'd love to see this feature added at some point.

Read on below. ----- Let spotify know you want this feature back: go to https://support.spotify.com/us/contact-spotify-support/ > Other > I still need help and write to them----- This is a request that Spotify undo their change over the last two weeks to remove the context-menu Playlist radio option from all their platforms. It is NOT sufficient to link to ""Where is Radio?"" https://support.spotify.com/using_spotify/system_settings/why-am-i-seeing-different-features-than-my... - this is not a communications issue, or a learning curve issue. We are asking very precisely that Spotify undo this change. Return the ""Playlist radio"" contextual option in all platforms. We further ask that it return for all objects, i.e all playlists (created by the user or other users), albums, artists etc. Basically: make it like it used to be.The most obvious example is that the create radio playlist option is missing from the right-click context menu on Macos and Windows. But all platforms now make it more difficult to create radio playlists.It disappeared for me on my Mac last week, Windows PC on Monday and Android yesterday.Once you get the update, to create a radio station you now need to go to Radio > Create Radio Station, this will then open a sidebar which you can type the name of your playlist into using your keyboard which will then give you the option to create a radio station. So the feature is effectively buried.I contacted support and they said:At Spotify, we’re often testing and launching improvements and new features. When we’re testing, you may see something on the app your friend doesn’t, or get a new feature for only a temporary period. Let us know what you think over at our Community.Seems like they are following an industry trend of removing features from their service to ""reduce complexity"".

Whilst singing might be fun, I have another approach to lyrics and sound, which is of course not mutually exclusive, and I read the words to see if I like them as I enjoy the melody, if I see myself in the lyrics, if I share the values expressed, and this is easier by having the words at hand. So please Spotify bring back the Lyrics Feature most elegantly -- as you did with restyling the Community -- when you find a better Lyrics Provider. Reading and listening might be even better than karaoke, although not as fun 😉 and every member could always do both, even just singing, as a very close person in my family does, and many other people do.

164,implemented,Cortana integration for Windows 10,benzj,"I think a very great feature for Spotify would be integration for one of Windows 10's most exciting features, Cortana. For example, you should be able to say ""Hey Cortana, play Hold My Hand by Jess Glynne on Spotify"" and it would not only open Spotify, if it wasn't already open, but it would also search through your music (or all of Spotify if needed) for the song (in this case, Jess Glynne's Hold My Hand) and play it. Here are some additional technical thoughts on how this would work:The addition of ""on Spotify"" to the voice command would differentiate requests to play songs from the computer/the default Windows 10 music appTo help streamline the song search process, the command could/would launch a search through Your Music/Songs first before searching all of Spotify, to help reduce the potential to reduce duplicates and the need to mention the artist. For example, if there are multiple songs named ""Next to Me"" on Spotify, but you only have Emeli Sande's song by that title in Your Music, and that is, presumably, the song you're looking for, it would search Your Music, find Emeli Sande's Next to Me first and play that.This feature would make things a lot easier for me, as Spotify is my main music player, and I'd like a quicker way to play songs from Spotify in Windows 10 without having to open the app and look for it myself.",03:40 PM,‎2015-08-03,,953,70,7,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Cortana-integration-for-Windows-10/idi-p/1181504?search-action-id=342735232078&search-result-uid=1181504,en

166,implemented,[Country] Launch Spotify in Romania,thedarq,"I think that given the current alternatives:- Zonga- Deezer- Apple Music (in the not-so-distant future) Spotify would be wasting a chance to get further into the eastern market if it does not launch in Romania as well. There are already a lot of musicians from Romania on Spotify, which means that securing licensing agreements couldn't have been that hard. Furthermore, following the example of deezer which comes bundled with Orange voice contracts, respectively zonga and vodafone, I think that Spotify could seize this opportunity to secure a deal with Telekom and either bundle their services or just outright open here as well. It makes a lot of sense especially since Spotify opened in Hungary and Bulgaria as well. The expansion would only be natural and it would also further drive down the hated piracy phenomenon in the balkans and eastern europe. In the 21th century on a competing market, spotify's ease of use, multiplatform, streaming quality and array of artists would ensure a switch over from the other services to spotify. I was told by a Spotify support representative, a few months back that it is planned to launch Spotify in Romania as well, however, somehow, those plans changed, and the ""official facebook page"" was taken down, and now, the official position is that nobody knows when this is happening. I only want to know the truth, and use this service without resorting to all sorts of loopholes to enjoy it. I think it's time people in my country are treated the same way others are all over europe. There's bad seeds everywhere, but I don't think everyone has to be held accountable for the actions of the few. If you demand respect, you should show respect.

174,implemented,[Desktop] Bring back volume normalization toggle,apecat,"The latest version of the Spotify desktop client [1.0.1.1060.gc75ebdfd] misses the crucial option ""Set the same volume level for all tracks"". It is no longer possible to disable volume normalization. This is downgrade is atrocious. Removing granularity from the options screen and forcing heavy audio processing degrades the value of Spotify to something suitable for non-paid background listening on Bluetooth boomboxes or laptop speakers. While normalization is extremely useful for background music, the option of disabling it improves sound quality, particularly for listening to certain quetly recorded albums and classical music. It's a switch in the UI and should be brought back as soon as possible. It seems to be the case that the normalization toggle never disabled all processing of the audio signal. But the option to disable volume normalization, which was added in early 2009, made the audio quality of Spotify usable for dynamic music and quality gear even before this service offered high bitrate streaming (mid 2009). This setback in audio quality arrives at an unfortunate time when Spotify comptetitors are scrambling to provide lossless, cd-quality streams in several streaming intense markets. It's sad to see Spotify level the playing field by crippling its (partially) native desktop app, which could be a competetive edge. The competition, even the ones aiming for the audiophile crows, typically rely on useless, offline incompatible browser based offerings for desktop and laptop users.Interested parties can participate in this Twitter thread.",07:47 PM,‎2015-03-06,,361,80,8,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Desktop-Bring-back-volume-normalization-toggle/idi-p/1040449?search-action-id=342735232078&search-result-uid=1040449,en

222,implemented,[All Platforms] Album Art for each Track in a playlist,lamina9,"View as Album List was a great feature. Based on comments I have seen on other forums, I am not the only one who thinks so. Please restore this feature. Reasons: 1) Images are much easier to see than text. I have reached the age of reading glasses. Before this feature was removed, I could easily find songs / albums in playlists. Now I have to find my glasses beforehand! 2) Images are much more compelling and attractive than text. A picture tells a thousand words etc. The whole look and feel of Spotify is enhanced through the use of album images. Removing them seems like going against good user experience practice. 3) Nostalgia. Although I love Spotify and I firmly believe that subscription is the future of music, I still feel some nostalgia for ""possessing"" a collection of albums. Displaying album covers reinforces the feeling of having a collection of albums in a playlist. Note that all three arguments apply equally to desktop and iPad versions of Spotify. November 2013: Response to the comments from Spotify... - There is no need for a cmd+G control. All playlists should always display the album cover. - The Collections product was announced almost a year ago but there is no sign of it. - A Collections product that simply displays the thousands of albums that I have ever listened to is not a viable solution in my opinion.

229,implemented,"Spotify needs to become more Album ""Collection"" based, it's too track-focused at the moment",philask,"Before Spotify I had (well still have, but mostly untouched these days) large MP3 collection organized into Artist/Album/Tracks folder structure. This worked well for me and combined with Playlists meant that I maintained my personal ""collection"" of ""Albums"" as well as favourite tracks and Playlists for particular occasions / moods. What I find these days is that I'm losing track of Albums, I have Spotify Playlists (although the flat Playlist structure tires me), but it's just not the same as having a personalized ""Collection"" of music. Spotify needs to add the ability to build your own ""Collection"" (not Library, which is still track based), this should be organized however you like, but at least providing Artist / Album / Year drill-down structure (folders or not). It'd be nice to match this against existing MP3 collections and Libraries. The ability to tag playlists and collections (and/or albums) would also be a bonus. What I'm getting at here is the missing part (for me) in Spotify is the ability to ""virtualize"" (cloudize?) my mental image of a music collection, which is shelves of albums sorted into some logical order (years, artists, genre, whatever), but mostly Albums, not just Tracks. My 2 cents. UPDATE 21/4/13: I don't seem to be ""allowed"" to embed images in my posts (sad). I've recently been using Google Music on a Nexus 10 and I have to say it has almost the perfect Album / Genre / Artist interface. I particularly love the way that in Artist view you see Albums stacked and they move subtly in 3D as you scroll. The only thing missing here would be Year and latest-added sort/views.

Google just ate your lunch, dinner and breakfast for the next 10 years. Google Play Music All Access has the above functionality (add any album to ""my collection"") and more, including a MUCH better visualization of your collection, album based browsing and a considerably better radio implementation. UPDATE 21/5/13: Spotify ignore albums, again It's pretty obvious now that Spotify have no interest in the albums or the art of constructing an album, don't they realize that most artists work for years to create a ""piece of work"" known as an album, not just a bunch of random tracks? Today Spotify launched their ""Charts"", which once again completely ignore albums... What with Google Play Music All Access and Rdio I think Spotify are going down the slippery fail slope to irrelevance. http://charts.spotify.com/ UPDATE 1/1/14: Looks like Spotify took this suggestion seriously and have been beta testing Collections for quite a while (yes, they made me a beta tester 😉 ) It works well and I'd imagine it'll be mainstream soon.

Spotify would definitely benefit from such a programme. Spotify could control it in a few ways: - make the sign up process relatively open - an example is Chrome where users can switch into the beta or even development release channels with a simple software switch - control it by making it invite only based on finding users on the forums who show technical/trouble-shooting ability - an example is Sonos where key members of the community definitely get to test-drive new releases. Spotify could also enforce an NDA on beta users, if it so wished, in order to ensure the general level of secrecy it likes to put around new features - again I'm pretty sure from previous experience that Sonos do this - it was obvious after the release of their Spotify tie-in that some forum users had been in the closed beta.

Importantly, this needs to happen on the iPad app. This idea would simply allow people to have a ""traditional"" record collection within Spotify which is what many, if not most users actually want.

Functionality Starring a song adds the artist and song to your library Starring an album adds the artist and album to your library Starring an artist adds adds them and all their albums to your library Everything is grouped, first by a user determinable category, then by artist. Artist appears as a 1 line summary. Buttons at the top determine groupings - A-Z then Artist, Genre then Artist, Decade then Artist An A-Z filter allows quick access to Artist and Genre when in that sorting mode. This becomes a timeline in Decade mode. Each time you drill to Artist there is a ""more"" button which links to the Artist Spotify page. Rather than choosing to make all Library tracks offline this is done at Artist, Album and Track levels with a button by the title.

I know the point of the ads is to annoy us into paying up, but it can be very painful to turn on some relaxing tunes after school/work, turn up the volume a bit to hear the quieter details, and then have a surprise advertisement blaring some awful hiphop noise or a screaming spokesman blast 5 times louder than the song. Just normalize the volume of ads so that they aren't louder than the song they follow. Ads should be the same volume as the music. This can be implemented by having an internal variable to measure the average volume within the song, and then set the ad's volume to that **bleep**. This way, classical concertos are recognized at the lower volume they are, and the next ad won't be 5 times louder than the loudest part of the song. Or just have a ""advertisement volume equalizer"" checkbox somewhere in the account settings. Or let us turn up the volume for just one particular quiet song within a playlist, so that everything else plays at normal volume.

277,implemented,Implement an actual shuffle function,RoninTheOrigina,"Yes, you read that right. The ""shuffle"" function in Spotify is nothing more than a randomizer. There's a difference? YES. RANDOM - Play one song. The next song can be ANY song in your playlist. Including the one you just listened to. Though I've never had this specifically happen, I literally just heard the same song that I heard 2 songs ago. This is how Spotify's ""shuffle"" currently functions. SHUFFLE - Take your entire list, shuffle them (like cards), and play the first song in the shuffle. Once finished, move that song off the pile. Once the pile is depleted, shuffle the deck again and start over (maybe pop a message up). I know enough about programming (not much) to know that shuffling is probably a bit harder than random, but come on. I may be in the minority, but I don't have a lot of little playlists. I have one list with nearly a thousand songs in it, because I like all the music, and am rarely not in the mood for one of those songs. But what I can't stand is hearing the same song over and over again. I think there may even be songs in my list I haven't heard yet, while I've heard others 4-5 times. I know it may not matter much, but I would probably lay down the money for at least a year subscription if this feature was implemented. EDIT: Another user pointed out that I can see what all is queued up in my shuffle by clicking the Play Queue link, and that Spotify supposedly sets up a rolling shuffle of 50 songs. It would be nice if this range could be expanded to say 50-100% of your playlist. EDIT 4/6/12: I just dealt with the same song 16 tracks later. The song played the first time yesterday afternoon. I went home, listened for a bit on my home PC (just a few songs), then started listening again this morning.

294,implemented,Make entire play queue editable,Dommedagsprofet,"There's currently two queues in Spotify: The editable queue. (""Queued tracks"")The locked queue. (""Next tracks"")If you press the queue button with tracks in both lists, you can see that these two queues follow each other. The editable queue always plays first. The problem is having a locked queue at all. You can't empty it without interrupting playback, and you'll have to use a workaround to do so. You can't reorder it or add or delete songs. After finishing the editable queue, Spotify always continues playback from the locked queue. The workaround is starting playback at the very last item on a page. The locked queue will then have no further items. Then you can continue by purely using the queue right-click function instead of double-click or enter. This adds items to the editable queue. These tracks can then be reordered and deleted as you wish. This UI behaviour is, however, not very user-friendly and quite frankly really annoying. It's also very unconventional having two queues in a music player. I've never seen any other software using either a dual-queue system or a locked queue system. Here's a good implementation suggestion from user Styrke: ----Google Play Music's queue system is really easy to understand and use. Just do what they do. I can describe it by three (3) easy bullets: Double clicking a song starts playing it and adds the rest of the list that the song came from to the queue.

Today, with HTML5, APIs exists for:Bi-directional secure (TLS) WebSockets with UTF8 or binary Native audio playbackA whole new types of input types such as ""search"" and ""range""2D Canvas Context for advanced dynamic drawing of 2D elements (lines, gradients, text, images, shapes, raw pixels)Realtime audio processing/analysis with the Web Audio APISandboxed FileSystem access (e.g. for offline playlists, local settings)Application Cache for offline usage of the appDrag & Drop API (e.g. for dragging tracks to playlists)History API for sessions and bookmarkingBinary data: Typed arrays/ArrayBuffer, Blobs and File API (for reading files, writing files)!XHR2: Binary data with Ajax/XHR requestsWebWorkers, multithreaded JavaScriptCSS3: Keyframe animations, smooth transitions, shadows, custom fonts, new selectors.PeerConnection API for Peer-To-Peer connections!!Today, Google Chrome (the world's second largest browser) got all of these APIs and more (except WebRTC, but it's in the dev build, so it will soon be here too). Chrome even have it's own built-in appstore (Chrome Web Store) where users can install extension/apps, without having to restart their browser. Another approach to get Spotify to the web is to use Native Client (NaCl) to compile C/C++ code for the web. An example is the game Bastion that was compiled with NaCl to run in Chrome.This would be the easiest way for the Spotify developers, as they only had to tweak their code very little to make it compile with NaCl.

Repeat TRACK 3.

It worries me that Spotify hasn't implemented this popular simple idea from 4 years ago, but instead they implement more complex newer ideas. If you ask some people -- this has been a request since the launch of Spotify. I love Spotify, but it hurts that a simple feature like this gets passed up every time new features are rolled out. I feel like I'm living in the 1990s with no repeat track mode anywhere to be found within Spotify. This is a basic feature and it's being looked at like a grain of salt. I comb through Twitter search every day and a lot of people are very confused on how the repeat mode works so I link them to this idea. I've referred 50+ people now to the link... some didn't know that it only repeated the playlist. This is very confusing for a lot of people, especially newcomers.

I understand that change can cause confusion and objection, but by doing this you have literally removed functionality that I use everyday. I regularly go to an album or playlist needing to see which songs I have already liked, I can’t remember the name of every song I like especially on film or movie soundtracks, but I do know that I want to listen to a song that I have liked from that album. Before this change I could see a heart icon indicating that I have previously liked that song, but now there is literally nothing at all to suggest that I have added it to any of my playlists, let alone the fact that I like it. There is a conceptual difference between “liking” something and “adding to a playlist” and I understand the change, but I think you may have forgotten about albums and have essentially removed functionality that some people may rely on. I’m not asking you to reintroduce “liked songs” but please introduce the tick back into albums so I can see which songs I have already added to a playlist. Or, if you do change your mind, please put liked songs back again, there was no problem with the way it was 😅 P.s. the plus icon makes no sense at all right now!! If I add a song to a playlist called “instrumental” the plus icon doesn’t change, but if I then click it, it adds it to my “liked songs” playlist.

I feel like all of my friends who use Spotify or other music apps also have at least one huge generic playlist with all kinds of music mixed together.These lists, over time, usually slowly drift from one genre to another, depending on the kind of music we're currently becoming more interested in. But once I find a genre I truly like and want to listen to it separately from everything else, I only have all of those songs in a big playlist with lots of other stuff mixed in. The goalRather than going through everything manually, it would be awesome if we could let Spotify do most of the work, and let it create the basis of a separate playlist focused on one type of music for us. The app is pretty good at finding similar music, so I assume the parameters to find similar music within a playlist are already there. An example of how this feature could work:For a playlist, we get the option to ""Filter songs into separate playlist"" (or a catchier name). Once you click it, you need to select a number of songs from your playlist. Once you've selected at least X songs or one or more genres, you can specify how big you want the resulting playlist to be. If I put in 20, Spotify will choose the 20 songs that are most similar to my original selection and throw them all into a new playlist for me, ""Selection of {original_playlist_name}"". Possible additions could be thatinstead of selecting initial songs, Spotify could also suggest prominent genres or artists in the original playlist;you can dynamically adjust the sample size, and see which songs get added/removed as you increase/decrease it;you get a popup with the next 10 most similar songs after creating the playlist, and can immediately add them to it.

336,closed,Songwriter,SHH5,My idea is that there should be a page where songwriters can post their lyrics on Spotify. But only for artists to see. Artists can like the post and request to have the lyrics for their own and the songwriter can approve who they think would be the best fit for their lyrics. The songwriter can take down any posts say if they have given the lyrics away so other artists know the song is no longer up for grabs. This would really improve the music industry and take Spotify to another level as to get your lyrics seen can be a challenging process.

It is a convenient way to listen to songs. However at present there does not appear to be a way to increase the chance for a particular song(s) to be played more frequently (in 'shuffle' mode) than any other song. So for example, I have liked the tracks ""You can call me Al"" and ""Original Nuttah 25"" so that they appear in my favourites folder, but I might want to play the song ""You can call me Al"" more frequently within the 'shuffle' mode than the track ""Original Nuttah 25"". I think the advantage of enabling functionality like this would allow users to have more granular control over the frequency by which tracks get played from within their favourites folder. A rating system like a clickable set of stars (or something similar) might work to achieve this? I understand that users can opt to use folders to separate their music (so that specific tracks get played more often than others) but if you prefer to continually add tracks to your favourite folder, instead of separating your music through folders, then it is a shame that there is no way to have more control over what tracks are played more frequently from within the favourites folder?",09:06 PM,‎2023-03-17,,0,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Mobile-Your-Library-Increase-control-over-track-frequency-in/idi-p/5522796,en

That idea is definitely something I would appreciate. While it is Library specific, I'd like to suggest a more pervasive set of UI filters. In my idea description, I'm going to refer to high level music Genres as Categories as that is how the Spotify API presents that concept. Subgenres of music will be called Genre, again to match the API. This idea is not suggesting changes to nomenclature, but I want to clarify these terms to ensure the idea's intent is clear. For instance, most people consider Hip Hop a genre (Spotify Category ID 0JQ5DAqbMKFQ00XGBls6ym) and if we look up an artist like Jay-Z (Spotify artist ID 3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB), he is associated with the following subgenres that appear like so in an API request:""genres"": [""east coast hip hop"",""hip hop"",""rap""] With that out of the way, my idea is as follows. Regardless of which screen I am using in the UI, I want to filter results based the following concepts (when applicable). I'm going to present these in a short user story format. As a user I would like to be able to filter results by Category on any screen that is not organized by Category already. As a user I would like to filter by based on Genre on any screen that supports filtering by Category or is already organized by Category. As a user I would like to filter results based on the type of release the result is classified as, including Albums, EP, Singles, or Playlists. I'd expect that non-music results would include or omit this filter based on the content type.As a user I would like to filter results based on when it was released. If possible, New (two weeks), Recent (last three months), This year, Last Year and then either by numeric year or decades (i.e. 2020s, 2010s, 2000s, 1990s, etc...)As a user I would like to see a column in results that shows which artist released the track, separate from all of the artists that appeared on the track.As a user I would like to filter results by the ""Release Artist"" column to quickly differentiate between ""featured on"" tracks and tracks released by a specific artistDependent on the above: As a user I'd like to have a way to perform some kind of negation search by release artist.

By filtering result type for Albums, I will not see all of the playlists, EPs, and singles. I'm searching for a specific artist but only want to see albums that were released by that artist. I'd start by searching for the artist's name then select ""Albums"" in the release type filter and enter the artist's name again in the Release Artist filter. I'm searching for a specific artist name but would like to only see results that were released by other artists.

A song group would be atomic and ordered. When adding a song to your playlist, you would get a popup asking if you want to add the song group or just the single song. If the song group is added to the playlist, when shuffled the group would be treated as a single song whereas it contains multiple tracks. A user could also change the way song groups are managed through the setting panel.",10:46 AM,‎2023-03-16,,0,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Playlists-Group-songs/idi-p/5521640,en

373,closed,[Community][Other] Make Spotify available in Somalia,katarighe,"Dear Spotify users, My name is Mohamed, a Spotify user from Canada. I'm temporarily living in Somalia as of October 2020 (during COVID-19) for personal & family reasons. I feel very bored when Spotify becomes unavailable in the location where I’m living and this is disappointing. Many people in Somalia were thrilled when Spotify has expanded to Africa 2 years ago, that was on February 2021. This included neighboring Kenya, Djibouti, and Ethiopia. However, users in Somalia are frustrated that Spotify hasn’t become available here yet. The company launched its service in to Ethiopia 3 months ago as of today. I am happy that I can listen to my favorite playlists in most parts of the world but frustrated that Spotify is taking a long time to launch its services in Somalia. Accessing via Virtual Private Network (free or paid) is also not worth it since Spotify does not allow listeners to use VPNs due to piracy or security concerns. After sending 2 separate emails to Customer Support team last month on this issue, a representative told me that the Spotify is still launching regularly in countries around the world and the process is not yet over. They recommended me to wait until the Spotify becomes ready in Somalia, especially when this page disappears (see screenshot below). While the Customer Support team can’t confirm if or when this is due to be released in the country, only the product teams are in charge of this issue. The only way to get their attention is to make my voice heard by the Spotify community, as listeners can then vote, discuss, and show their support for my proposal/idea. Therefore, I am proposing this idea to the community recommending Spotify launch its service in Somalia. Millions of Somalis want to get their hands on the millions of songs exclusively on the portal that are not available anywhere else, like YouTube, SoundCloud, or Deezer, which remain available in the country. In the last 5 years, Spotify expanded its service to 180+ countries from Europe and North America to Africa and the Pacific Islands without any restrictions, representing 90% of the world population, and the access is very similar to YouTube or Netflix. To support my idea/proposal, I conducted a survey of around 100 people living in the country asking them if the platform should become available or not, and here are the results:All of the participants agree that Spotify should become available in Somalia and no one has opposed my idea/proposal.Right now, the majority of the population access Music via the YouTube video-streaming platform.If Spotify is launched, dependence on the platform (YouTube) would be significantly reduced.Stream-ripping and other piracy-related Music activities would also be over, as they will rely on the internet for listening to music and podcasts. Somali artists at home and overseas have been releasing their songs on Spotify for the past few years, which can only be accessible to the Somali diaspora community where Spotify is available and not here.Similar to the Ethiopians, the Somali diaspora is mostly present in Canada, the US, the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Africa (especially countries bordering Somalia), and the Middle East. Common artists on the platform include Hassan Aden Samatar, Sharma Boy, and K’Naan.One participant told me that if he can access millions of movies and TV shows on Netflix – then why not Spotify do the same as well with their songs and podcasts?Aside from the survey, here is the overall situation of Somalia (following research):Not subjected to international sanctions or embargoes, similar to Cuba, Syria, Iran, North Korea, and Sudan.Has PayPal, Visa & Mastercard payment services allowing users to make online purchases, such as Spotify Premium.Uses Somali Shillings (SOS) and United States Dollars (USD) for domestic transactions while USD is used for international transactions.Has high-speed internet access like Fiber Optic (up to 50 megabytes) and 4G LTE (up to 100 megabytes).The number of internet users in Somalia has increase to a 3-digit figure in the past decade.Over 70% of Somalis have access to 4G LTE Mobile Internet with 5G currently on the works.Considered as one of the top countries in the world with affordable high-speed internet.In 2020, the country ranked number one in Africa, and seventh worldwide in terms of mobile data prices.1GB of data costs $0.5 USD and unlimited high-speed internet of $15-20 USD monthly. Compared with Canada, that is 5 to 8 times cheaper here.I pay nearly $100 CAD (or $75 USD) monthly for 100GB data, with hidden data charges.Mobile data plans in Canada are the most expensive the world. Official languages of Somalia are Somali, Arabic, and English, similar to the Arab World and Djibouti.Here is the screenshot below saying that Spotify is inaccessible in my country. When I attempt to manage my account details and my music playlists, the request is denied and redirects to the page instead. It is quoted as ""Spotify is currently not available in your country. Follow us online to find out when we launch."" My IP address is 102.68.17.7 and the location is Mogadishu, Somalia, the browser is Google Chrome and the operating system is Windows 10. On the opposite, was able to access Spotify via Virtual Private Network (VPN) but the system will prompt me to turn off before using it and will return back to the same message (per screenshot). I have now concluded with my discussion. Besides your vote, feel free to ask questions regarding this post. I'm ready to answer them comprehensively. You are also welcome to give comments on what my life is like without Spotify. 😁😁 Thanks,Mohamed Proud Spotify listener since 2019.",06:24 PM,‎2023-03-17,,0,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Community-Other-Make-Spotify-available-in-Somalia/idi-p/5522697,en

The Spotify algorithm is really impressive so it's annoying when it's providing me new music in a genre I don't need any new additions to. There should be a way to stop including certain music when Spotify calculates what music to generally suggest you. There are two easy solutions: 1. a button that stops a playlist from influencing your algorithm. 2. a button that turns off your listening habits' influence on the algorithm for a set period of time (suggestion: 8-10 hours) before reverting back. I think the playlist switch feels more intuitive (as many people don't even include the songs on these in their likes) but I am always in support of more advanced user controls to let us realize the algorithm as a tool and aide.

Even in the primary categories of ""Health & Fitness,"" disability is not an option amongst alternative health, fitness, medicine, nutrition, mental health, and sexuality. The lack of disability as a category or even a subcategory for podcasts mirrors a critical problem in our society - ableism. Creating a podcast category for “disability” helps the disabled community in several ways:1) it makes it easier to find podcasts relating to disability, therefore, more accessible to those who are searching them out2) it helps disability podcast creators to be more discoverable to the demographic of people who are searching it out Being disabled has historically been stigmatized and those within disabled community are working to change that. We are a large community - disability does not discriminate, it impacts every other identity factor: race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, and socio-economic status. We deserve the ability to have convenient access to content that we can relate to, we deserve representation. Will Spotify be the first to make this bold step for our community?

463,closed,[Desktop][Developer] More accurate and sensible volume slider,Cheesebag,"The Spotify volume control is a pain to work with. It's been a while since I've seen audio or video software that has this problem, but apparently the most popular audio streaming service is unable or unwilling to implement a proper volume slider. This includes the web service and desktop app. The problem: the slider is linear and our hearing is not. The slider is zero at the one end, 100% at the other end, 50% in the middle, etc. But our hearing is much more sensitive to small variations in amplitude for silent sounds than for loud sounds. In practice, the lower end will appear to be very sensitive, lacking fine control. This makes it difficult to set the correct volume anywhere around the lower/middle end of the slider, while any changes in the lower 10% are barely even noticeable (because you're so close to zero already). In the first graph below you can see how the same increase in volume on the slider will result in a different perceived loudness change depending on how loud the music is. The solution can be quite simple: use an exponential scale. That will make your controls feel significantly nicer and more usable. A volume slider using such a scale will counteract our logarithmic hearing, resulting in a linear perceived loudness scale, where every change in the slider position will always result in the same perceived loudness difference no matter how loud the music is initially. E.g. slide it up 10% and it will always sound 10% more loud.The conventional conversion factor would be 10^(-30/20 * (1-x)). This calculation will produce an energy multiplier that will reduce loudness by 30 decibels when x is 0, and will leave it at full volume when it is 1. Each 0.1 increment of 'x' would change perceived loudness by exactly 3 decibels, which is a pretty commonly recommended increment for volume controls.Few users care about the units but this will feel much more natural and helps them to find the correct volume as easily as possible. Exponential, logarithmic loudness attenuation is the way to go.",11:19 PM,‎2021-09-14,,-1,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Desktop-Developer-More-accurate-and-sensible-volume-slider/idi-p/5259896,en

I have one main playlist with all the songs that I like and sometimes I add songs to the playlist to make sure that I have them there, expecting to see the notification pop up where it says that the song is already there and ask if I want to skip duplicates but it doesn't and I am 100% sure that i've had that song in the playlist before and listened to it in this playlist specifically.I have searched for the song in the playlist to see if I have it but from another album because that happens sometimes but a lot of times I don't have the song at all even though I am 100% certain that it's supposed to be there. I've noticed as well that my old playlist that I had years ago had over 2000 songs but now it only has 1000. Can it have something to do with spotify changing the directories of the songs like if the song is in an album they remove the single and if I have the single in my playlist it gets removed? Or if an artist release a deluxe version of an album and spotify removes the regular album because it doesn't need to be there anymore when the deluxe album is there and better, and if I have songs on my playlist from that album they will be removed from my playlist?

487,live,[All Platforms][Playlists] Add the same song to multiple playlists simultaneously,conner_thewhite,"There is no reason why Spotify shouldn't have a functionality on at least the desktop app where you can drag one song into as many ""selected"" playlists as you want and have that song added to all of them at the same time… Here's a little more info to back up this request: I'm, for one, the kind of person who obsesses over music, and a huge component of that is the way in which I organize my playlists. I believe it is probably safe to say that most people wish their music was better organized, but the primary reason why they aren't is simply the amount of time it takes to put together quality playlists. Instead, what most people end up with are a small handful of enormous playlist hundreds, if not thousands, of songs that have no rhyme or reason to why they are in the same playlists. To avoid this dilemma, I have spent hours and hours sorting through all my favorite songs and making different types of playlists that they may fit into. One thing I learned early on is that a particular song is likely going to fit into multiple playlists, and this is where the problem lies and the primary reason why most people avoid making well thought out playlists altogether. In order to add a song to all the playlists I want, I have to sit at my computer and continuously drag a new song I want put into different playlists into each individual one over and over again which, when organizing dozens or even hundreds of songs, can take an insane amount of unnecessary time.

This is often abused to hurt record labels and playlist curators. After contacting support - the account of someone who abused this system gets taken down. This person then creates another email and free Spotify account and repeats the process. There is a simple solution to the problem - enable reporting feature only after 10 hours of music/podcasts were streamed using the account.

This feature could allow users to select two or more songs and have the AI create a mashup that combines elements of each track to create a new and exciting remix.I believe that this feature would be highly appealing to users who are looking for a new and innovative way to experience music.

The iPad app isn't' too bad (the desktop app is in need of an upgrade but I hear they are putting all their efforts into mobile apps right now). So - lossless streaming - if Qobuz can do it then so can Spotify, they must have the same source - and obviously if you are asking £20 a month then those record labels and distributors take enough notice to make the high res tracks available for streaming. What this all means is soon, very soon, we will get lossless streaming and closely followed by high res downloads - but if Spotify aren't careful it will be Apple who get there first with an audiophile premium offering, and when they do it will be a much harder market place to make money in! ** please don't lump this suggestion with the main one on lossless downloads, that's a different idea entirely guys!",12:44 PM,‎2014-03-02,,26232,4610,461,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/All-Platforms-Music-HiFi-Quality-Lossless-Streaming-16bit-44/idi-p/700006,en

You can step up and join the DJ queue, and all DJs in the room play one track, one after another. The friend feed on the right side turns into a chatbox, and you can communicate and talk about music while listening to the same tracks. Think tuntable.fm, plug.dj, jqbx.fm, ... but right inside Spotify! Check out this Medium article by Austin Condiff I found today, detailing this concept (following mockup taken from that article). I've been hoping to have some social aspect like this within Spotify, and I think this would enrich the community even further. You could create rooms based on genres or moods, and enjoy music together with friends and strangers alike.

509,live,[Other] Location-based music suggestions,GoodIdeasMan,"Dear Spotify Feedback Team,I am writing to share an exciting idea for a new feature that could revolutionize the way users experience music on your platform. The idea is to introduce location-based music suggestions, which would allow users to enjoy customized music experiences that reflect their current location and environment.The location-based music suggestions feature would use geolocation data to detect the user's location and suggest playlists or tracks that are tailored to the environment. For example, if the user is at the beach, Spotify could suggest playlists with beach-themed music, while if the user is in a forest, Spotify could suggest playlists with more relaxing or natural sounds. The music would change dynamically based on the user's location, seamlessly transitioning from one playlist to another as the user moves from one environment to another.The feature could also include curated musical regions, which would showcase the unique musical cultures of different regions and locations. These curated playlists could be created in collaboration with local artists, music historians, or tourism boards, and would allow users to discover new music and cultural experiences that are specific to each location.We believe that the location-based music suggestions feature would be a great addition to the Spotify platform, providing users with a personalized and engaging music experience that is tailored to their current location and environment. This feature could be particularly useful for travelers or those exploring new regions, but could also be a great way for anyone to discover new music experiences that are unique to their local area.Thank you for considering this idea.

524,live,[Playlists] Ability to link together Tracks in Playlists,bvacaliuc,"Hi, Wouldn't it be great if you could ""pair""/""link""/""lock"" or ""chain"" tracks together in a playlist? Then even if you shuffle-played, certain songs would always play together. mock-up of how linking/pairing a song might work. This idea was actually started by @Sartoris in 2012: https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Ability-to-link-together-tracks-in-playlists-also-for-... But in 2015 it was closed as not having enough votes. Coincidentally, about the same time, I signed up for Spotify premium. As I listened to all the songs I've ""liked"" with shuffle, the one thing that kept coming into my mind was the terrible feeling you get when a song that is meant to follow another is not played. You get the feeling of being violated; it is a terrible experience. As I searched for this feature, I saw that idea was marked inactive and decided to open it again. That idea had gotten 138 likes in 2015 and as of January 2020 has gotten another 116 for a total of 255. There were another 18 ideas then that all linked to the one above (see attached). So I re-submitted this idea in 2015 and since then you wonderful people have given it over 880 votes! Thank you! From the rules, we see that we needed to have over 500 votes to keep the topic alive in monthly discussions (check!). We also see that we need 100 votes per year to keep it alive (check again!). So we're in good shape on that front. Now we have to see what we need to do to get it moving forward from ""Not Right Now"" to ""Under Consideration"". Again, from the rules above, Spotify says that they use these criteria:Helping artists.Data and other information we've collected.Information from research testing, focus groups, and surveys.Feedback in the Community and other support channels. (That's us!)Our overall short- and long-term business strategy.Hmm. Ok. So I would say that playing tracks that are meant to be together really helps the artists because their work is rendered in the correct way that they intended. I'm wondering how many artists are dying inside when their specially arranged songs are cut up because someone shuffled their playlist? I can't speak to Spotify's data and research, focus groups and surveys, or about their business strategy. However, it occurs to me that anything that affects the order of which song plays can affect revenue because Spotify pays someone when a song gets played and they don't pay the same amount of $ for every song... Sure its a tiny fraction of a cent, but it adds up. So my first guess is that Spotify's hesitation to implement this idea is economic. I think we should continue the discussion along these lines to see if we could come up with some kind of consensus on this notion. Letting a song ""pair"" with another in a playlist would be enough to make a lot of people happy. Would we be willing to put some $ behind having this feature? Lets say Spotify charged you $0.01 (a cent) everytime you were shuffle playing and the queue hit a linked song and played the one that came after it. Would you be ok with that? If not, what would make it ok? I think answering the economic question is one thing that is keeping this idea from moving forward. @wsmyth commented in May 2019 that he would be willing to spend $1/month for this feature. I would do that too, would you? From the many, many great comments, @WesleyM77 posted in April 2019 a link to a US Patent. There are two patents, actually, [US8214740B2] and [US9396760B2]. Reading through the two patents, it's clear that they cover this idea in many of its possible methods. So apart from the economic impact, Spotify may be prevented by the patent holder from implementing this feature. It has been noted that only one service has this feature, and now this explains it. The patents expire in 2030. So, here we are. We want a feature, someone has successfully patented the feature and so we can't have nice things. Everyone including the patent holders want to make money, so is there a price that Spotify could negotiate with the patent holder and then pass on to the users that would be acceptable to all parties? Spotify, would you look into this and get back to us?

526,live,[Mobile] See all Songs on Artist Page,TLuck,"Dear spotify, First of all, thanks for your awesome service! I really enjoy my premium account on my desktop and iPhone version and use it at home and wherever I go. However there's something that bothers me often while searching for a song, especially on the iPhone version. I often search for a song of a specific artist. So I use the search function and reach the artist's page. Once there, the app only shows the 5 most popular songs of the artist. But often the song I'm looking for is not listed there (maybe nr 6 on the list or lower). Now I have the option of searching through the albums, which can be quite time consuming, or try to use the search function again and hope to find it with a more specific combination of words (provided that I know anything more than the artist's name). Now every time I get to this I'm thinking why can't I tap a button ('see all songs') which allows me to see all the artist's songs in a list? That is something I'm looking for intuitively. On the desktop version, the list of 5 can be extended to 10 most popular, but also here I'm thinking: why only 10?! Actually, the list I'm looking for can be brought up by the app already by playing the first song (while not in shuffle mode) and tapping the playlist icon. This brings up the kind of list I would like to see: all the artists songs I can just browse through. Only now I'm playing the first song, which I didn't want to hear at all. Preferably, I would want to be albe to sort the list in order of popularity or alphabet.

It seems the only group session option is now remote group sessions, where the music is played on each individual device. This group session, ""play from same device"" feature was personally one of my favorite features of Spotify. When it was first introduced, I quite literally showed all of my friends to use it. I understand it was in beta, but this feature was used by many people, quite literally all the time. We know this feature did not work perfectly, but we would use it regardless of the tiny flaws, it was honestly my favorite thing about Spotify. Whenever I, or any group, would have friends over, I would always offer to start a group session so that everyone could contribute to the music being played. Having this option, friends could seamlessly contribute to the music being played so that one person would not selfishly play music the entire time. It was so fun having everyone able to contribute, without having to hand over the one single phone to everyone that was connected to the device, just to add a few songs to the queue. Having someone scan a code and then instantly able to add songs to the queue was a perfect idea for hanging out with friends, in person. It appears with the new update, there is only an option for remote group sessions where the music is played on each individual device, I'm asking to consider bringing back the ""play from same device.""

I've realized that I haven't found any new artists or any new music, and just continuously listen to the same things over and over again which is quite depressing. The point of the song radio or at least how I use it is to discover new artists that are in the same realm of the artist I'm listening to, and I think you all at Spotify are putting everyone - artist AND listener - at a huge detrimental disadvantage by having it go that way because then there is no discovery for new artists and there is no way for listeners to get into new music without scouring the platform instead of giving good recommendations based off your algorithm. More than anything I want to be able to discover new artists based off song radio, not just hear the same songs I've been listening to.

This functionality not only assist with the time intervals but would also provide users with an increase in volume when they are in need of ""extra motivation"" for instance. For example: Take for instance, running intervals on a treadmill. This user wants to run for 1 minute and walk for 2 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. The user would create an interval with a ""high"" and ""low"" volume. Let's say low is set to 25%, high is set to 50%. The user would then input the duration for both volumes which in this case will be: low set to 2 minutes, high set to 1 minutes.

558,live,[All Platforms] Option to have a true shuffle.,jonathanleyerle,"So I’ve been noticing more and more recently that Spotify’s default shuffle feature doesn’t fully shuffle your songs. It does some sort of grouping to try to get similar songs together based off of what I’m sure is dozens of factors. Every time I shuffle a playlist (the one I noticed this with the most is ~100 songs and 6 hours of mostly full albums) it will group the songs mostly or completely together by album/artist, and given the number of times I’ve re-shuffled and checked the order there’s no way it’s just a coincidence. They also generally seem to be in the same order as well. If I hit shuffle play on a playlist it’ll generally put the same artists at the beginning every time. With larger playlists of albums I am really not a fan of this shuffling method. If I have 6 hours of music on a playlist I will hardly ever have 6 hours to actually listen through the whole thing, but when I do listen to it I would like to hear all of the music on it equally, and not just the artist or two your algorithm likes to shuffle to first. Anyways, I’m a reasonable man, all I’m asking for is an option to have a true shuffle (take all songs in the list, put them in a random order, and once they’re all played reshuffle them and play them again). Make it premium only if you want. I don’t think you should scrap the current shuffle algorithm because it sucks. Looking at some of the suggestions on here it seems like some people lobbied hard to have it that way. Just add an option for a true shuffle for those of us that don’t care about potentially getting the same song twice in a row.",05:00 AM,‎2020-01-06,,1953,820,82,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/All-Platforms-Option-to-have-a-true-shuffle/idi-p/4880594,en

It's great for anyone learning a new language or who needs to find a specific part of a song's lyrics, and especially for deaf people who, different from what is generally expected, also like to enjoy music on Spotify and this feature makes the experience more accessible.However, a similar feature has not yet been implemented in podcasts, which is a shame as there are many creators producing extremely relevant content on the platform, but, for lack of an accessibility feature, this content doesn’t reach as many people as possible and many creators choose to make their content available on platforms that respect the diversity of their audience.By making some updates to the karaoke feature that already exists on the platform we can have a Spotify more accessible to everyone. The ideal is a tool that generates an automatic description of the spoken content, as present in other online platforms, but also allows edits to be made by the content creator itself.And then it should be automatically synchronized with the audio and available in the desktop and mobile version as well.This update will bring more people to Spotify, as many people consume podcast media looking to learn a new language and would like to be able to check words they don't understand well, in addition, browsing the synchronized caption of the content allows you to find which part of a particular episode has the information that the person is looking for.Most importantly, it will highlight the issue of accessibility for people with disabilities and initiate a dialogue with the disabled people community, because deficiencies are part of human diversity and must be respected.",07:29 PM,‎2021-05-06,,4611,90,9,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Podcasts-Subtitles-for-Podcasts/idi-p/5200537,en

641,live,[All Platforms][Discover] Setting to prefer original (explicit) content over clean alternatives,muldrr,"IssueWhile listening to music, especially when listening to through Autoplay after an album, through Discover, Daily Mixes or automatically generated playlists, Spotify often plays the ""clean"" edits of songs that have their original version tagged as explicit.The option ""Allow playback of explicit-rated content"" is there for people who don't want explicit content, but the behavior of this option is not ideal for people who have it enabled.If an explicit version of a song exists, I do not want to hear the censored, chopped up version with often mangled lyrics. I want to hear the original song as the artist intended it. In my opinion the clean version is nearly always inferior to the original.Currently it seems like the use-case of people who want to hide explicit music is valued higher than the use-case for people who want to listen to the original. I would argue that we should be treated at least equally. ExampleWhat got me here today was while listening to ""Ten thousand hours"" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, and hearing ""Make sure the soundman doesn't block-block the drums"" and hearing frequent ""Shht""'s really breaks the flow of the track.What especially triggered me, is that it showed that I had ""hearted""/liked the song. I did like the original version, and it occurs in multiple playlists of mine. The clean version does not.Note that this is not a complaint about this song in particular, it is just an example that occurred today. Proposed solutionIf the ""Allow playback of explicit-rated content"" option is ticked, the ""clean"" content is very likely of no value to the user, and should never be favored over the original version.If you do not want to force this behavior to the entire userbase, or change existing behavior for existing users, then an option could be to add an extra opt-in setting to ""Block playback of clean edits when original is available"" or something similar. So basically the exact opposite of the currently already implemented ""Allow playback of explicit-rated content"" is desired: never allow clean edits.Your team might well come up with a different, perhaps better solution, but the end goal would be to never have to listen to a ""clean"" version again when the original is available. Previous submissions and discussionsMany ideas have been submitted before, they are however all closed, marked as duplicate, marked as ""unclear"" or found to have not enough votes.This new submission is an attempt to combine all previous efforts and hopefully get some traction.While not all of the options discussed below are exactly the same, they are all about this topic and they all suggest some way of playing the original over the clean edit.If you see all the previous topics in the table below (there are probably others that I might have missed), it is clear that this is a frequently brought up topic in the community.Hopefully listing them here helps people find this feature request.

649,live,"[Playlists] Expand ""Discovered On"" User-Generated Playlists on Artist Profiles to Show On Mobile",outtallectuals,"BackgroundEarlier this year with Spotify's UI change, user-generated playlists (UGP) were removed from artist profiles, before subsequently returning on desktop (with some expansion to now show 50 playlists when pressing 'See All'). Despite the initial scare, it was nice to see that Discovered On made *some* come-back, but it needs more. It's currently unfair that Spotify only shows its own playlists on Mobile, completely removing visibility on UGP.In fact, with Spotify's recent streamlining of Web/Mobile/Desktop App UIs to all look and function similarly, this new addition shouldn't be difficult at all. If anything, I imagine Spotify is actively omitting Discovered On from artist profiles on mobile now (You can see this in the A/B difference attached, between the Mobile & Narrow Desktop App window view, which are practically the same, except the omission of Discovered On).I'm requesting for Discovered On to show on Mobile as it does on Desktop, so that:- Listeners can tap into the huge world of user-curated playlists to find similar artists. - Independent curators (labels, bloggers, influencers, etc.) can still have visibility for their playlists, and not drown in an overly monopolized Spotify environment.- Artists can also obviously enjoy getting more discovery and visibility through a largely available yet untapped resource, especially artists who DEPEND on third party curators, i.e. those not picked up by Spotify algorithms and editorials which are arguably most artists on the platform.How To Achieve This:It's very simple.

655,live,[All Platforms][Other] Romanized Lyrics for Songs Not In Latin Alphabet,amknana12,"Recently, Spotify (at least in my iOS app) has added a very helpful feature which is lyrics. It finally collaborated with Musixmatch (thanks God why haven't you done this sooner). Problem is, I am an Indonesian listener who is familiar with Latin alphabet. I loved many Asian songs, which we know, are not written in language using those Latin alphabets, namely K-Pop, J-Pop, or you name it. Those songs' lyrics are still shown in their original alphabet (K-Pop in hangeul, J-Pop in kanji and hiragana, etc). Usually, foreign listeners are able to sing-a-long by looking at the romanization version. Now I know that Musixmatch indeed does not have that romanization lyrics, but Genius does and I know Spotify has partnership too with Genius, I guess? So, why not give a choice for listeners to choose between Genius or Musixmatch? TL;DR:1. We want romanized lyrics to Asian songs or any songs not using Latin alphabet2. Give options for Spotify listeners to choose which version to show3. If Spotify can no longer show Genius' service, push Musixmatch so that they make romanized lyrics available. Sincerely,Global Spotify member. [UPDATE]A comment below notified me that Musixmatch has provided options for translations and indeed they are now shown in Spotity. I see this as a nice improvement!

This allows me to switch tracks, like music, etc. while working on the iPad without having to use my limited mobile hotspot data. However, “hiding” a track from a list (daily mix, radio etc.) does not transfer from the iPad’s playlist to the current playlist running on the iPhone. Therefore, ”hide song” also does not force a skip to the next track. Similarly, hidden tracks on the iPhone are not displayed as such on the iPad. This makes curating lists of music using multiple devices frustrating at best. It’s important to note that “liking” a track does in fact immediately sync to the other devices and therefore hiding a track should also be possible. Thank You. Add on: Also, please fix “hide song” so that it syncs to all playlists throughout my account. If I don’t want to hear a song, I NEVER want to hear it again.

The Dragonfly Red runs at 44.1kHz with Spotify on my PC but on Android it up-samples to 96kHz causing glitching. Other DACs have similar issues. The proposal is for Spotify to access USB DACs directly, bypassing the Android driver. Audiophile music players already take this approach, e.g. USB Audio Player PRO (UAPP) and Neutron. Tidal works with UAPP. This idea is a version of ""Support USB Audio through the USB Audio Player PRO driver"" without the 3rd party partnership. It was written in response to @meahtenoha's review. Both ideas originate from the USB audio out OTG support thread. External USB headphone DAC/amps for Android phones are becoming a thing.

Hence the idea of additive playlists and subtractive playlists. This will consist of one pair of two playlists. One will have the full array of songs -- the additive -- and one will have that array minus the ones you take out -- the subtractive. On the diagram below, 1 is the additive playlist and 2 is the subtractive (For my example, you could think of 1 as February and 2 as February Night). When I add a playlist to February, it goes into February Night as well. And when I add a song to February Night, it also goes into February (blue arrows). But when I remove a song from February, I don't want it anywhere; it's removed from both. If I remove a song from February Night, it's only removed from the one (red arrows).

751,live,[Playlists] Shuffle+ A new shuffling method,Haisom,"Hello everyone! Ever wondered why everyone is still stuck on same old Shuffle? Whether is shuffling non heard songs properly or is just completely Random, it's still always the same. How about improving this tech a little bit? This idea was already posted once through this link: https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Music-Supreme-Shuffle-among-artists-albums-etc/idc-p/4...However, it didn't get enough kudos per year, but I'm ready to try again and be more engaging with the community that share same expectations from Spotify. Shuffle+ is all about listening all your favorite songs in the most diverse order you never thought would be possible. ""How?"" you may ask. Simple. Instead of being a random shuffle, or true shuffle, Shuffle+ would works as a filter check where you can choose what to Shuffle or not. Example 1: Imagine my standard Favorite playlist from Spotify is already ordered by Album. So every time you play it, it will always play the same songs in the very same order. From album to album, alphabetically. However, I'm feeling like listening to them on a different order, but still want to enjoy whole albums or artists separately instead of shuffling through musical genres. So, you would do this: [ ] Artist [x] Album [ ] Track [ ] Genre Then hit play! What would this do? Spotify would only Shuffle+ among albums until that artist's albums in your favorite playlist are over, then, it would play tracks in order from the next artist's albums with similar genre, because only album was checked . For this to work they would need to add a new Column on library just for Genres. If not, we would only be able to shuffle among artist, album and tracks, though, with random genres. Example 2: [x] Artist [ ] Album [x] Track [ ] Genre This would make Spotify play a artist's whole tracks in shuffle mode, independent of albums, meaning albums order would be random, but all his songs would be played, no matter what. Then, would go to the next Artist and repeat it to that artist, and so on. Example 3: [ ] Artist [x] Album [ ] Track [x] Genre This one would make Spotify Shuffle among Albums and Genres, don't minding Artist or Track order. Once one Album from one Genre finished, it would play the next Album in the next Genre. If Genre is not implemented by Spotify, then it would be like example 1. Example 4: [x] Artist [x] Album [x] Track [x] Genre This would work just like usual Shuffle. Example 5: [x] Artist [x] Album [ ] Track [ ] Genre This would play one artist album in proper tracks order, then Shuffle to another artist's album and repeat. REMINDER: Always remember that whenever Shuffle+ is active, only what is selected will shuffle. Unselected items should play in proper order. Now... How would that look like? Just like the 'Loop' option alternates among 'Loop All', 'Loop One', and 'Loop Off', the 'Shuffle' button could alternate the same among 'Shuffle', 'Shuffle+', and 'Shuffle Off'.The concept of the ""check boxes"" to select what would be included in shuffle could be done by touch/holding 'Shuffle' on media player button to open up the 'Shuffle+' menu, where the main/first option would be 'On/Off', then the second would have the ""tags/checkboxes"" to pick what you want to shuffle. Doing so would save that as you preset for Shuffle+, always using it whenever you're cycling among Shuffle option. This means if the user wants to change how his Shuffle+ shuffles through content, he would have to open that menu. Hope you all get the idea. If you don't, please say in the comments and I will try to make it clearer. PS: Not intended for Liked playlist only or Freemium users. Since this is a really complex shuffle method, would only apply to Premium and would apply to all available platforms if possible. Please! Comment bellow what are your thoughts, what could be improved, if you liked it or not. I will update the idea as we get more opinions about it so we can improve it together. HELP SHARING THE WORD! =D -----CHANGELOG----- *Update 08/23/2021 - Fixed example 3 as I got confused with the explanation.

This is even more important when listening to playlists made by other people, to help me discover new music.The new algorithm could be called something like ""serendipity shuffle"" or ""discover mode"".

Right now mixes are enterily dependent on algorithms, however I think users should have a degree of personal input on how mixes are built. For example, it would be great if users could select a couple of songs and then have Spotify create a mix based on those songs. It would also be great if users could remove a mix and replace it with another, or merge different mixes into one. For example, Spotify created two different EDM mixes for me, one based on house music, and another based on tech house tracks. I find that a little redundant and I would like to merge both mixes into one. There's also another mix which is a weird combination of ambient, IDM, downtempo and indie rock tracks (?). I would like to split that mix in two, one for indie rock and another for IDM, downtempo and ambient music. And then there's a pop/R&B mix which I'd like to replace entirely with a jazz music mix, since I don't listen to that much mainstream pop and R&B music in the first place. Expanding the number of daily mixes to 8 would be great as well, since 6 mixes doesn't quite cover the variety of music I tend to listen to.

This is pretty inconvenient seeing as 99% of the time I’m not using my phone for Spotify if i'm planning to listen to music while going to sleep. Obviously i don’t know the ins and outs of adding such a feature but surely something so small can’t be hard to implement?

831,live,[Desktop][Playlists] Let us change our playlist's accent color,TerryZúñiga,"Let us choose an accent color for our playlists, and not from a preset color palette chosen by the app, but with any color we can think of. This would be for aesthetic purposes only, yet I think that many users wish they could have that option. (At least let us use that option on the desktop and let the color show on the phone, tv, desktop, etc.) The problem is that when you add a custom thumbnail to your playlist, Spotify sets an automatic accent color to it. Sometimes you can get lucky and have it match your thumbnail, sometimes it just looks dull. Also, it always picks a different color for the phone and desktop apps. So it would be pretty nice if you just let us do that job instead of the AI. We would have a consistent color for all apps and we would all enjoy more aesthetic playlists!

There's a list of apps which are adding support for this feature here: https://9to5google.com/2022/08/27/android-13-themed-icons/ It's a good plan to add it soon because currently users consider the Spotify app icon because it's an eye sore compared to other themed app icons.

Some buttons are currently play and some are shuffle. Why not put both buttons there so we can choose if we want to shuffle it or play it? Right now to play in order you can press or click on the first item in the list, but with the different types of play buttons this is still confusing for most users. Shuffle can also be controlled by clicking on the shuffle button on the now playing screen. Right now the play buttons are inconsistent across all of the Spotify apps. On mobile it was recently changed so now when you go to album pages, the button at the top is no longer a shuffle play button but instead a regular play button. Playlists still have the shuffle play button on mobile. On desktop all play buttons are regular play buttons and do not shuffle. See how confusing that is? Why not do like other music apps already do and have both a PLAY and SHUFFLE option buttons at the top of the playlist or album. Problem solved, you get to pick how you want to play it. Doesn't make sense how inconsistent it is currently. I never use the play buttons because you never know if it's going to shuffle or regular play. I just click the first song in the list to play the songs in order usually and if I want to shuffle I just turn shuffle on from the now playing view. For artist pages you can just leave it the way it is now with only a shuffle play button since playing in order wouldn't make sense. You could still add it and pressing the play button would play their most recent releases in order.

My suggestion is to place a toggle and indicator at the top of the 'Friend Activty' sidebar so that users can turn on and off their activty sharing with ease and be aware of their sharing status. This will not totally resolve the issue because a user will need to have the 'Friend Activity' sidebar enabled to see it to start with but it is a start to making this functionality far more accessible and obvious. An additional change would be to place a 'Share Activty with Friends' button under the 'Private Session' button in the profile dropdown menu with a green check mark to it when enabled similar to what the 'Private Session' button does when enabled.

906,live,[Search] Globe Learning 🤓,EmanueleRagusi,"I am Emanuele and I am 16 years old. I thought about an interesting idea that I would add to your platform. I would build a world map, where artists all around the globe are shown up and you can zoom in and look for what people in that specific country/city are listening to. I would add it in the premium accounts to incentivize people to buy it. That would bring people to know more artists and be able to listen to foreign artists more easily. For instance, I would like to improve my German, what's the best way to do it? Listen to German music and learn new vocables. So, what shall I do? I'll just go to the main world map of Spotify, zoom on Germany, and look for artists. I'm pretty sure that this innovative idea could bring Spotify Premium listeners different benefits!

907,live,[iOS] Allow custom iOS widget color scheme,mmcgill829,"Thanks for implementing a widget for the app for iOS14. However, the lack of the ability to set a static color scheme is frustrating. The widget automatically changes color based on playlist/artist image, but doesn't seem to adjust to black/white. Many users have spent a large amount of time setting up custom icon sets and themes that this widget clashes with. I have a black/white setup on mine, for example, and the bright green widget just doesn't work. Would be as simple as adding a menu in settings for widgets and allowing choice between color schemes. Should be fairly easy from a coding perspective.",06:19 AM,‎2020-10-18,,276,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/iOS-Allow-custom-iOS-widget-color-scheme/idi-p/5055360,en

It would be good to allow a default extreme quality setting on all devices used on my account or to allow setting the quality in the iOS/Android app. Support says Spotify transcodes from their native Vorbis codec to 256kbps AAC, which further reduces audio quality, especially since Chromecast Audio seems to natively support Vorbis. Spotify should strive to make their service use the best possible audio quality on any platform, and that doesn't seem to be the case right now with Chromecast.",12:49 AM,‎2018-07-07,,395,40,4,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Chromecast-Stream-highest-possible-Quality-to-Chromecast/idi-p/4523194,en

912,live,[Android] Resizable Android Widget,zachc94,"As of 1/8/2018 the spotify widget is currently on a 1x4 size. Many newer phones have the ability to hold more icon columns (more than 4) therefore the spotify player looks poorly made and ill fitting. I know that google play, and samsung play provide the ability to resize the widget to match the width/# of icon columns you have on your screen. Can it be possible to allow the widget to be resizeable like other music playing competitor apps? It feels weird that spotify doesn't take this idea into account.

918,live,Redistribute Spotify on Linux Distributions,NicoHood,"Dear Spotify Team,my name is NicoHood and I am an official ArchLinux Trusted User. This means I maintain some packages in the official [community] repository [1]. I am also able to move packages from the ArchLinux User Repository (AUR)[2] into [community] if the packages are popular enough (>10 votes). As you can imagine spotify is really popular on ArchLinux with more than 1100 votes on AUR[3]. Me and the community would love to have spotify in our official repositories to provide our users a simpler channel of installing Spotify on ArchLinux. The problem we face is that the Terms of Use forbid us to redistribute Spotify. We'd require an official statement that ArchLinux is allowed to package Spotify in its repositories. I've already contacted Brendan Marsh (Product Owner, Desktop) about this topic via email without any further response. It would be nice if you can give the linux community a better channel for installing Spotify on non-debian systems. Furthermore we then can cooperate and optimize spotify for ArchLinux (e.g. using more shared libraries, providing gpg signed tarballs and https downloads etc). Me and the community hope to get some positive feedback. Thanks for taking the time. Please upvote this post if you also with to natively install Spotify on ArchLinux and other Linux Systems.
