1,implemented,"[Mobile][Your Library] ""Spotify Playlists"" folder",Peter,"Idea: Create a separate folder in Your Library (similar to Your Episodes for podcasts - see screenshot) where all your Spotify editorial playlists are saved when liked. Use case: I'm a heavy mobile app user and I have liked countless numbers of Spotify playlists, but I don't have an easy way of finding and organising them. Instead of users having to do so manually, Spotify could create a separate directory where, every time I like a Spotify playlist, it is automatically saved under it. It could simply be called ""Spotify Playlists"". Currently (as of Spotify for Android version 8.6.88.1104), you can go to Your Library, filter by Playlists and sort by Creator, and scroll down to S to see a list of your saved Spotify playlists. However, the advantage of having a separate directory (in addition to ease of use) is that it would be able to have additional features and sorting capability (e.g. by genre/mood, similar to Liked Songs).",08:52 AM,‎2022-01-04,implemented,102,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Mobile-Your-Library-quot-Spotify-Playlists-quot-folder/idi-p/5322875?search-action-id=347302516555&search-result-uid=5322875,True,"Updated on 2022-10-12 Hey folks,     Thanks for coming to the Spotify Idea Exchange and voting to make this happen.     We're happy to announce that this feature is now available on mobile.     Once again, thanks for helping us make Spotify better, by participating here on the Community.

16,implemented,[Desktop][Playlists] Paste Songs in Playlist at Specific Point,brayden1121,With the new UI update the ability to paste songs at a certain point in a playlist seems to be missing. I have some pretty long playlists that I use custom ordering with. Having the ability to paste songs I recently added to it at a certain point was really helpful. This allowed me to highlight a song near where I wanted the new songs to go and when I pasted the cut songs would be pasted right below it. This saved a lot of time because I didn't need to drag songs from the bottom of the playlist after they were added through the playlist for minutes at a time. This was a great feature and I hope something to replace it or the feature is reinstated. It appears that right now when I try to do this the songs are pasted at the end of the playlist. I have not found a new feature or workaround to this at the moment. This idea implies the existence of the ability to cut rather than just copy songs in a playlist as well so I didn't feel the need to create a separate idea post for that feature. This also doesn't have to be exactly as I described it. A way to move songs to a certain point in a playlist in any way is just what I am looking for.

Read on below. ----- Let spotify know you want this feature back: go to https://support.spotify.com/us/contact-spotify-support/ > Other > I still need help and write to them----- This is a request that Spotify undo their change over the last two weeks to remove the context-menu Playlist radio option from all their platforms. It is NOT sufficient to link to ""Where is Radio?"" https://support.spotify.com/using_spotify/system_settings/why-am-i-seeing-different-features-than-my... - this is not a communications issue, or a learning curve issue. We are asking very precisely that Spotify undo this change. Return the ""Playlist radio"" contextual option in all platforms. We further ask that it return for all objects, i.e all playlists (created by the user or other users), albums, artists etc. Basically: make it like it used to be.The most obvious example is that the create radio playlist option is missing from the right-click context menu on Macos and Windows. But all platforms now make it more difficult to create radio playlists.It disappeared for me on my Mac last week, Windows PC on Monday and Android yesterday.Once you get the update, to create a radio station you now need to go to Radio > Create Radio Station, this will then open a sidebar which you can type the name of your playlist into using your keyboard which will then give you the option to create a radio station. So the feature is effectively buried.I contacted support and they said:At Spotify, we’re often testing and launching improvements and new features. When we’re testing, you may see something on the app your friend doesn’t, or get a new feature for only a temporary period. Let us know what you think over at our Community.Seems like they are following an industry trend of removing features from their service to ""reduce complexity"".

Whilst singing might be fun, I have another approach to lyrics and sound, which is of course not mutually exclusive, and I read the words to see if I like them as I enjoy the melody, if I see myself in the lyrics, if I share the values expressed, and this is easier by having the words at hand. So please Spotify bring back the Lyrics Feature most elegantly -- as you did with restyling the Community -- when you find a better Lyrics Provider.

165,implemented,Cortana integration for Windows 10,benzj,"I think a very great feature for Spotify would be integration for one of Windows 10's most exciting features, Cortana. For example, you should be able to say ""Hey Cortana, play Hold My Hand by Jess Glynne on Spotify"" and it would not only open Spotify, if it wasn't already open, but it would also search through your music (or all of Spotify if needed) for the song (in this case, Jess Glynne's Hold My Hand) and play it. Here are some additional technical thoughts on how this would work:The addition of ""on Spotify"" to the voice command would differentiate requests to play songs from the computer/the default Windows 10 music appTo help streamline the song search process, the command could/would launch a search through Your Music/Songs first before searching all of Spotify, to help reduce the potential to reduce duplicates and the need to mention the artist. For example, if there are multiple songs named ""Next to Me"" on Spotify, but you only have Emeli Sande's song by that title in Your Music, and that is, presumably, the song you're looking for, it would search Your Music, find Emeli Sande's Next to Me first and play that.This feature would make things a lot easier for me, as Spotify is my main music player, and I'd like a quicker way to play songs from Spotify in Windows 10 without having to open the app and look for it myself.",03:40 PM,‎2015-08-03,implemented,953,70,7,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Cortana-integration-for-Windows-10/idi-p/1181504?search-action-id=347302482081&search-result-uid=1181504,True,"Updated on 2018-01-11Hey folks, Cortana + Spotify integration is now live on Win10 releases from RS2 and later.

167,implemented,[Country] Launch Spotify in Romania,thedarq,"I think that given the current alternatives:- Zonga- Deezer- Apple Music (in the not-so-distant future) Spotify would be wasting a chance to get further into the eastern market if it does not launch in Romania as well. There are already a lot of musicians from Romania on Spotify, which means that securing licensing agreements couldn't have been that hard. Furthermore, following the example of deezer which comes bundled with Orange voice contracts, respectively zonga and vodafone, I think that Spotify could seize this opportunity to secure a deal with Telekom and either bundle their services or just outright open here as well. It makes a lot of sense especially since Spotify opened in Hungary and Bulgaria as well. The expansion would only be natural and it would also further drive down the hated piracy phenomenon in the balkans and eastern europe. In the 21th century on a competing market, spotify's ease of use, multiplatform, streaming quality and array of artists would ensure a switch over from the other services to spotify. I was told by a Spotify support representative, a few months back that it is planned to launch Spotify in Romania as well, however, somehow, those plans changed, and the ""official facebook page"" was taken down, and now, the official position is that nobody knows when this is happening. I only want to know the truth, and use this service without resorting to all sorts of loopholes to enjoy it. I think it's time people in my country are treated the same way others are all over europe. There's bad seeds everywhere, but I don't think everyone has to be held accountable for the actions of the few. If you demand respect, you should show respect. To people that want to support my idea: Please give it a kudo and make sure to share this with all of your Spotify buddies ! 🙂 Thank you !",10:48 PM,‎2015-06-09,implemented,223,60,6,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Country-Launch-Spotify-in-Romania/idi-p/1149683?search-action-id=347302482081&search-result-uid=1149683,True,Updated on 2018-06-16Hey there!   Spotify is available in Romania for a while now. 🙂,2018-06-16Hey

Based on comments I have seen on other forums, I am not the only one who thinks so. Please restore this feature. Reasons: 1) Images are much easier to see than text. I have reached the age of reading glasses. Before this feature was removed, I could easily find songs / albums in playlists. Now I have to find my glasses beforehand! 2) Images are much more compelling and attractive than text. A picture tells a thousand words etc. The whole look and feel of Spotify is enhanced through the use of album images. Removing them seems like going against good user experience practice. 3) Nostalgia. Although I love Spotify and I firmly believe that subscription is the future of music, I still feel some nostalgia for ""possessing"" a collection of albums. Displaying album covers reinforces the feeling of having a collection of albums in a playlist. Note that all three arguments apply equally to desktop and iPad versions of Spotify. November 2013: Response to the comments from Spotify... - There is no need for a cmd+G control. All playlists should always display the album cover. - The Collections product was announced almost a year ago but there is no sign of it. - A Collections product that simply displays the thousands of albums that I have ever listened to is not a viable solution in my opinion.

230,implemented,"Spotify needs to become more Album ""Collection"" based, it's too track-focused at the moment",philask,"Before Spotify I had (well still have, but mostly untouched these days) large MP3 collection organized into Artist/Album/Tracks folder structure. This worked well for me and combined with Playlists meant that I maintained my personal ""collection"" of ""Albums"" as well as favourite tracks and Playlists for particular occasions / moods. What I find these days is that I'm losing track of Albums, I have Spotify Playlists (although the flat Playlist structure tires me), but it's just not the same as having a personalized ""Collection"" of music. Spotify needs to add the ability to build your own ""Collection"" (not Library, which is still track based), this should be organized however you like, but at least providing Artist / Album / Year drill-down structure (folders or not). It'd be nice to match this against existing MP3 collections and Libraries. The ability to tag playlists and collections (and/or albums) would also be a bonus. What I'm getting at here is the missing part (for me) in Spotify is the ability to ""virtualize"" (cloudize?) my mental image of a music collection, which is shelves of albums sorted into some logical order (years, artists, genre, whatever), but mostly Albums, not just Tracks. My 2 cents. UPDATE 21/4/13: I don't seem to be ""allowed"" to embed images in my posts (sad). I've recently been using Google Music on a Nexus 10 and I have to say it has almost the perfect Album / Genre / Artist interface. I particularly love the way that in Artist view you see Albums stacked and they move subtly in 3D as you scroll. The only thing missing here would be Year and latest-added sort/views.

Google Play Music All Access has the above functionality (add any album to ""my collection"") and more, including a MUCH better visualization of your collection, album based browsing and a considerably better radio implementation. UPDATE 21/5/13: Spotify ignore albums, again It's pretty obvious now that Spotify have no interest in the albums or the art of constructing an album, don't they realize that most artists work for years to create a ""piece of work"" known as an album, not just a bunch of random tracks? Today Spotify launched their ""Charts"", which once again completely ignore albums... What with Google Play Music All Access and Rdio I think Spotify are going down the slippery fail slope to irrelevance. http://charts.spotify.com/ UPDATE 1/1/14: Looks like Spotify took this suggestion seriously and have been beta testing Collections for quite a while (yes, they made me a beta tester 😉 ) It works well and I'd imagine it'll be mainstream soon.

However, I really miss the ability to view all of my Facebook friends like in the People tab in the old client. In the new system, the Follow tab only offers suggestions and it is difficult to locate a single friend. All I am suggesting is a simple ""View All"" button in the Follow tab: Which would allow me to view all of my Facebook friends with the Follow/Unfollow buttons shown, therefore making it easy to find a single friend, rather than currently having to either dig up a playlist from Facebook online or coninually refreshing the suggestions box. Handy Tip: If you are connected to Facebook, you can view any friends profile by typing their name into the main desktop search box, their profile should be offered as a suggestion under the heading ""Users"" (image in spoiler below).

Vote for this post if you want LOCAL PLAYBACK OF FLAC FILES ONLY. WHY WE NEED SPOTIFY TO PLAY OUR FLAC COLLECTIONSpotify already plays ALAC, all be it with stability problems, but what we really need is local FLAC playback because FLAC is the defacto standard for lossless audio encoding. 7digital has recently started selling FLAC yet spotify can't play them. Why not??? http://www.7digital.com/find-music/7digital-recommends/flac The most commercially successful band on the planet (The Beatles), have released official remastered versions of all albums in 24bitFLAC format on a usb device. http://www.everythingusb.com/the-beatles-stereo-usb-limited-edition-17961.html Numerous bands have sold albums in FLAC format through their websites.

A big problem is that you have to get the name right literally while many times somebody tells you about an artist or album and you don't know the exact spelling. Spotify does offer suggestions but they are not so good. It would be far better if it would be more like Google where it searches for the literal words first and then parts of the words. That way its also easier to come into contact with artists you never knew since the results would be much more diverse since they are not limited to the exact wording but parts of it.

Spotify would definitely benefit from such a programme. Spotify could control it in a few ways: - make the sign up process relatively open - an example is Chrome where users can switch into the beta or even development release channels with a simple software switch - control it by making it invite only based on finding users on the forums who show technical/trouble-shooting ability - an example is Sonos where key members of the community definitely get to test-drive new releases. Spotify could also enforce an NDA on beta users, if it so wished, in order to ensure the general level of secrecy it likes to put around new features - again I'm pretty sure from previous experience that Sonos do this - it was obvious after the release of their Spotify tie-in that some forum users had been in the closed beta.

262,implemented,Group Library by Artist then Album A-Z on the Ipad App,TED209,"There are many similar ideas to this going around but I think this is the easiest way to implement a sensible library management system within spotify, by making changes to the Library system's functionality. It's slightly different to other suggestions which is why I've posted as a new idea. Importantly, this needs to happen on the iPad app. This idea would simply allow people to have a ""traditional"" record collection within Spotify which is what many, if not most users actually want. It is similar (but improved) to the Rdio ""collection."" Functionality Starring a song adds the artist and song to your library Starring an album adds the artist and album to your library Starring an artist adds adds them and all their albums to your library Everything is grouped, first by a user determinable category, then by artist. Artist appears as a 1 line summary. Buttons at the top determine groupings - A-Z then Artist, Genre then Artist, Decade then Artist An A-Z filter allows quick access to Artist and Genre when in that sorting mode. This becomes a timeline in Decade mode. Each time you drill to Artist there is a ""more"" button which links to the Artist Spotify page. Rather than choosing to make all Library tracks offline this is done at Artist, Album and Track levels with a button by the title. The Library system then becomes the ultimate collection management tool and playlists then go back to what they truly should be - mixtapes.

265,implemented,Turn down the volume of loud ads,fractalblaze,"Prevent ads from being louder than the song that came before it. I know the point of the ads is to annoy us into paying up, but it can be very painful to turn on some relaxing tunes after school/work, turn up the volume a bit to hear the quieter details, and then have a surprise advertisement blaring some awful hiphop noise or a screaming spokesman blast 5 times louder than the song. Just normalize the volume of ads so that they aren't louder than the song they follow. Ads should be the same volume as the music. This can be implemented by having an internal variable to measure the average volume within the song, and then set the ad's volume to that **bleep**. This way, classical concertos are recognized at the lower volume they are, and the next ad won't be 5 times louder than the loudest part of the song. Or just have a ""advertisement volume equalizer"" checkbox somewhere in the account settings. Or let us turn up the volume for just one particular quiet song within a playlist, so that everything else plays at normal volume. To all fellow Free users, please take my survey on what you do when an ad is BLASTED at you- I'm sending the responses to the companies being promoted by obnoxious ads, to let them know that loud ads reflect badly on them when we rip off our headphones. Also, contact the companies whose ads are BLASTED at you, and ask them to tell Spotify not to blast their ads. Shari's Berries apologized to us, and a McDonalds rep said they only design ads. Keep it up! Contact the marketing department of these companies and politely ask them to demand a normal volume for their ad.

278,implemented,Implement an actual shuffle function,RoninTheOrigina,"Yes, you read that right. The ""shuffle"" function in Spotify is nothing more than a randomizer. There's a difference? YES. RANDOM - Play one song. The next song can be ANY song in your playlist. Including the one you just listened to. Though I've never had this specifically happen, I literally just heard the same song that I heard 2 songs ago. This is how Spotify's ""shuffle"" currently functions. SHUFFLE - Take your entire list, shuffle them (like cards), and play the first song in the shuffle. Once finished, move that song off the pile. Once the pile is depleted, shuffle the deck again and start over (maybe pop a message up). I know enough about programming (not much) to know that shuffling is probably a bit harder than random, but come on. I may be in the minority, but I don't have a lot of little playlists. I have one list with nearly a thousand songs in it, because I like all the music, and am rarely not in the mood for one of those songs. But what I can't stand is hearing the same song over and over again. I think there may even be songs in my list I haven't heard yet, while I've heard others 4-5 times. I know it may not matter much, but I would probably lay down the money for at least a year subscription if this feature was implemented. EDIT: Another user pointed out that I can see what all is queued up in my shuffle by clicking the Play Queue link, and that Spotify supposedly sets up a rolling shuffle of 50 songs. It would be nice if this range could be expanded to say 50-100% of your playlist. EDIT 4/6/12: I just dealt with the same song 16 tracks later. The song played the first time yesterday afternoon. I went home, listened for a bit on my home PC (just a few songs), then started listening again this morning.

295,implemented,Make entire play queue editable,Dommedagsprofet,"There's currently two queues in Spotify: The editable queue. (""Queued tracks"")The locked queue. (""Next tracks"")If you press the queue button with tracks in both lists, you can see that these two queues follow each other. The editable queue always plays first. The problem is having a locked queue at all. You can't empty it without interrupting playback, and you'll have to use a workaround to do so. You can't reorder it or add or delete songs. After finishing the editable queue, Spotify always continues playback from the locked queue. The workaround is starting playback at the very last item on a page. The locked queue will then have no further items. Then you can continue by purely using the queue right-click function instead of double-click or enter. This adds items to the editable queue. These tracks can then be reordered and deleted as you wish. This UI behaviour is, however, not very user-friendly and quite frankly really annoying. It's also very unconventional having two queues in a music player. I've never seen any other software using either a dual-queue system or a locked queue system. Here's a good implementation suggestion from user Styrke: ----Google Play Music's queue system is really easy to understand and use. Just do what they do.

Today, with HTML5, APIs exists for:Bi-directional secure (TLS) WebSockets with UTF8 or binary Native audio playbackA whole new types of input types such as ""search"" and ""range""2D Canvas Context for advanced dynamic drawing of 2D elements (lines, gradients, text, images, shapes, raw pixels)Realtime audio processing/analysis with the Web Audio APISandboxed FileSystem access (e.g. for offline playlists, local settings)Application Cache for offline usage of the appDrag & Drop API (e.g. for dragging tracks to playlists)History API for sessions and bookmarkingBinary data: Typed arrays/ArrayBuffer, Blobs and File API (for reading files, writing files)!XHR2: Binary data with Ajax/XHR requestsWebWorkers, multithreaded JavaScriptCSS3: Keyframe animations, smooth transitions, shadows, custom fonts, new selectors.PeerConnection API for Peer-To-Peer connections!!Today, Google Chrome (the world's second largest browser) got all of these APIs and more (except WebRTC, but it's in the dev build, so it will soon be here too). Chrome even have it's own built-in appstore (Chrome Web Store) where users can install extension/apps, without having to restart their browser. Another approach to get Spotify to the web is to use Native Client (NaCl) to compile C/C++ code for the web. An example is the game Bastion that was compiled with NaCl to run in Chrome.This would be the easiest way for the Spotify developers, as they only had to tweak their code very little to make it compile with NaCl.

If you ask some people -- this has been a request since the launch of Spotify. I love Spotify, but it hurts that a simple feature like this gets passed up every time new features are rolled out. I feel like I'm living in the 1990s with no repeat track mode anywhere to be found within Spotify. This is a basic feature and it's being looked at like a grain of salt. I comb through Twitter search every day and a lot of people are very confused on how the repeat mode works so I link them to this idea.

335,closed,[Radio] Jazz Fans: Remove the Bird Soundtrack from auto play for Charlie Parker,superreggie,"Jazz is an important genre to Spotify. And Charlie Parker is possibly the greatest of all jazz musicians. Whenever his music comes up in any autoplay situation, very often selections come up from the ""Bird"" soundtrack. All the tracks from the Bird soundtrack have his horn playing lifted out of the original context, and are accompanies by modern musicians. And so they are not actually his music as intended, and certainly sound out of place and different than the actual recordings. This is interesting for a movie, but it is controversial, and it is SUPER annoying if you want to just hear some actual Charlie Parker recordings. That was the kind version. Someone could easily take the approach that this whole approach is an abomination, that it never should have been allowed. I personally don't take it that far, but I do find the recordings really irritating. And for the new listener just trying to discover Charlie Parker's music, this is totally misleading, and even confusing.

341,closed,[All Platforms] No Ads in Podcasts for Spotify Premium users,Montesi,"I pay for my subscription. Every month for years now. The main reason I am a paid-for subscriber with Spotify is so I don't have to hear ads. As I have shifted my podcast listening from other providers to Spotify to bypass ads, both from the platform as well as integrated into the content. I expect not to hear ads on Spotify. I understand there are ads woven into the actual content of the podcast itself, but for as big of a company and the amount of leverage Spotify has, I expect to not hear ads so long as I am paying for the service. I reached out to Spotify and got this lazy, generic answer from Joy in Spotify Customer Support: “if you're hearing ads on podcasts using this Premium account. It's possible that the podcaster integrated that ads to their podcast content”. Thanks for breaking your back on that response. I KNOW what the ads I’m hearing are. And I understand they can’t ask podcasters to export two versions, one with integrated ads and one without. What I expect from Spotify is to either implement metadata that tags the beginning and ending of ad segments and bypass them for us, Premium subscribers, or require podcasters to give metadata timecodes that Spotify can identify to bypass them AUTOMATICALLY. Just to be clear, even if these identifiers are put into the content, I don’t want to have to pull my phone out to hit any sort of “skip ads” button. This is literally the ONLY reason users have Premium. So get rid of the ads. It’s actually very simple. And let’s not get started on how archaic it is to continually hit the “15sec forward” button to bypass the ads, first over shooting, then undershooting the duration of the integrated ad, only to have to make peace with hearing the last ten seconds of the ad. At that point it’s not servicing either party in the transaction. It’s 2020. You are a huge company with a lot of leverage and a huge developer budget. I honestly can’t believe I’m even having to write this suggestion. tl:dr - Spotify, I am a Premium member. You made a promise to me that if I became a Premium member, I wouldn’t hear ads.

This idea however, in it's core fundamentals, requires to change how the Premium subscription works and what opportunities Spotify offers to Podcast creators.   As part of the Premium subscription, all music can be enjoyed ad-free. And while Spotify doesn’t play ads that interrupt the music listening experience of Premium subscribers, some podcasts may include advertising, host-read endorsements, or sponsorship independently of the streaming platforms featuring such podcasts.   Providing a way to circumvent those is not something that our Idea submission process can accomplish. This doesn't mean that your feedback isn't heard and that this request couldn't be fulfilled by some other means in the future. On the contrary, this is being monitored and we invite everyone to share their opinion in a constructive manner.

Here are some suggestions to enhance the live session experience for both hosts and followers:Notification to Followers: When a user starts a live session, it would be great if their followers could receive a notification about it. This would help increase engagement and make it easier for followers to join the live session and interact with the host.Chatting and Commenting: Adding a chat or comment box during the live session would enable users to discuss the songs being played or share their comments. This would foster interaction and create a sense of community among the participants, making the live session more engaging and enjoyable.Song Recommendations: Allowing followers to recommend songs during the live session would make the experience more inclusive and interactive. It could also provide the host with new song suggestions and keep the session fresh and dynamic.Like Button: Similar to the feature in Instagram Live, a like button would allow users to express their appreciation for the host's performance or a particular song. This would provide feedback to the host and encourage them to continue delivering a great live session.Microphone Option for the Host: Giving the host the option to use a microphone to speak or announce songs would add a personal touch to the live session. It would also enable hosts to make transitions between songs or engage with their audience in a more interactive way.Overall, I believe that incorporating these features would make the live session feature on Spotify more interactive and enjoyable. Music is all about sharing emotions and connecting with others, and enhancing the live session experience would align with Spotify's mission of bringing people together through the power of music.

You can version your protocol so that you can detect which version of the client is connecting and run the old version of the server for that client.

It doesn't have to involve a lot of extra work on your part just to leave older versions of your server available for the client to connect to.

381,closed,[ALL PLATFORMS][MUSIC] Custom start and end times for each song,MarkV68,"There needs to be more than just a general crossfade. Some songs have a COLD OPEN OR COLD ENDs and with the crossfade active on a song that has a traditional fadeout into a song with a COLD OPEN, you miss the opening lyrics of the COLD OPEN song.Conversely, when a song has a COLD END, you're fading in a song in the background with no ability to bring it in at a specific time.And the BIGGEST trainwreck is a COLD OUT to a COLD OPEN. Being able to mark in and out on songs adds to the flow of a playlist, especially a party/dance playlist.EXAMPLE: You Oughta Know-Alanis Morissette, COLD OPEN. If the previous song fades out, you miss the open lyrics. Yes, you could have a short crossfade, but the previous song may go to almost silence before starting this song. And that would only apply to that one segue. Or how about the COLD OUT of Love Runs out-One Republic? I longer crossfade would bring in the next song early and cause this song to fade out instead. Go with a short crossfade and this song ends and the next song may start with a long silent intro making for bad song transitions.

My idea isn’t too far from listening party’s, but I feel it is very much organizing that idea.I can use a very specific example relating to how I would use this feature: I work in a close-knit company and a lot of my friends and coworkers recommend each other music, and we come over to talk about what we’re listening to and listen to the same things. I think if my company put out an invite link to a “Listeners Group” we could all join, see what we are all listening to at any moment while people are in the group, and listen along to anyone of our choice. Another good example would be an influencer making a group and fans could all listen to similar music together, they could come into the group, look at what people are listening to and join in on somebody else in the group.The convenience factor of this update would be allowing someone to create a link and posting it publicly inviting everyone to the organization’s group, and showing the people in the group by name, and what they are listening to. Not necessarily a playlist or showing certain songs, just showing people and their current listening activity.I think this would help me a lot in my current social situation, listening to similar music with buddies at work.",04:09 PM,‎2023-04-14,closed,0,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Listener-Groups/idi-p/5539570,True,"Updated on 2023-04-17Hi @GavinMcDermid,   Thanks for bringing your feedback to the Idea Exchange.   We’re closing this idea since it doesn’t meet one of our Idea Exchange guidelines, namely “Checking for existing ideas”.   A similar idea has already been suggested here - feel free to add your +Vote.   If you think your idea should be considered as separate, feel free to submit it again  highlighting how your idea is distinct from the existing one(s).   Cheers!",2023-04-17Hi

407,closed,[Mobile][Discover] Location Based Artists / Song Suggestions,KuyaKale,"Hello, my name is Kyle. I have an idea to implement a feature that allows users to discover music within the area / location they are in. For instance, if a user happens to be in the city of Philadelphia, this feature will recommend songs that are being listened to in the Philadelphia region and nearby areas up to an X-mile distance, whether it be popular mainstream songs, or smaller artists. Meanwhile, users presently on the West Coast will discover artists in the regions they are presently in (i.e., Bay Area versus Los Angeles region-based music). The idea here is that the song / artist suggestions provided to the user are driven by what the residents of the particular area are listening to. The benefits I see here are: - This could potentially help local artists get discovered. Whereas trending local artists have historically gained their followings through word-of-mouth, this idea states that through 1st party data collection and geo-targeting, users will get recommended music that residents of the area are listening to. Local, community-driven artists with smaller followings will experience increased exposure as both visitors and born-and-bred natives seek to discover new artists or releases by established artists from those areas. - Avid travelers will gain firsthand exposure to trending music in their areas. We can all agree that music has roots-- ties to its artists' origins both figuratively and geographically. This feature would add to users' traveling experience, providing them with new music from those areas to discover, while simultaneously giving artists and creators increased potential to get discovered (tying back to the first point). Thank you for taking the time to consider this idea-- I believe this could be a beneficial feature for listeners and creators alike. I look forward to hearing back from your team.

Since music rippers feed off of links to copy and paste to other websites, my idea is for Spotify, YouTube, and other platforms to allow signed artists and independent artists to have the choice to enable/disable links beside whatever they upload when using distributors like Distrokid. And also have the choice to enable/disable your playlists to have links or not. You would still be able to bring people to your profile with the profile link. This is just a major way to wreck music rippers plans because they ignore copyright warnings and try to steal and profit off of what we create. We also lose money because if it’s stolen, they won’t stream it which means less money for the artists and probably Spotify too because they won’t use Spotify unless they want to rip another song.

445,closed,[Mobile][Social] Sending Songs / Mailbox,planetfenix,"Problem #1: Many users (such as myself) are sent songs from friends via Spotify link in imessages, this often takes place at inopportune times; the message gets lost in the chat and the user never returns to listen to the song. Spotify should have an additional full menu that acts as a mailbox similar to Instagram's direct messages. That being said, there should be a few MORE features than Instagram's DMs to promote user engagement with Spotify. The Mailbox should have the following features: - Can send Followers songs - Users can react to songs with similar reactions as apple's imessages reactions (thumbs up, thumbs down, heart, and laugh) - I would suggest mailbox should not have the ability to send users chat messages due to safety concerns- reactions only. - Optional toggle setting to let friends know when you have listened to their song (similar to Read receipts) - Artists can blast send all Followers their new music. This makes fans more likely to interact with the songs and have it sitting in their 'mailbox' instead of being notified once in the app about a new release.- Users should have a toggle setting to turn this feature on and off in case they do not want artists to send them new songs - Songs in the mailbox end up in a Spotify-generated playlist of Received Songs similar to other spotify-generated playlists such as Episodes. Users have the option of removing songs from this playlist if desired. This change could lead to a significant boost in user engagement with Spotify and would promote users to use Spotify to send songs instead of going outside to other sources such as Youtube. Users would have more of a draw to use Spotify as they would see songs in their Mailbox and be enticed to listen to them on their own time. Artists could promote songs easier and users could feel more connected to their favorite artists through Spotify.",06:45 PM,‎2023-03-30,closed,2,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Mobile-Social-Sending-Songs-Mailbox/idi-p/5531122,True,"Updated on 2023-04-12Hello @planetfenix!Thanks for bringing your ideas to the Community.

452,closed,[Playlists] Tethering,Balty89,"Often times, Albums are not only made, but constructed specifically and meticulously. Producers like Metro Boomin', most notably with his hit Superhero on HEROES & VILLAINS, has a track at the beginning of his album called On Time. On Time is borderline a prelude to what is really the titular track Superhero. But this premise can be found in many Albums (and not specific to the beginning of the album, but really, songs with seamless transitions into the next song), Jaden Smith's B, L, U, E, The Weeknd's How Do I Make You Love Me going into his single Take My Breath, with many more examples. Tethering, as it applies to playlists, is a toggle-based feature, that can 'tether' two, or more, songs together. When the playlist is put into shuffle, songs that are tethered, will always play in order, and in sequence. If a user were to tether Jaden Smith's B L U E, then when the shuffle gets to the Tethered Grouping, it will play all in sequence, IF the tether has been activated. Seeing as BLUE is a collection of 4 songs, putting them in a shuffle is risky business, as the user might hear U before B or vice versa.
