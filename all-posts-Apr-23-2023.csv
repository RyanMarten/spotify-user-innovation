1,implemented,"[Mobile][Your Library] ""Spotify Playlists"" folder",Peter,"Idea: Create a separate folder in Your Library (similar to Your Episodes for podcasts - see screenshot) where all your Spotify editorial playlists are saved when liked. Use case: I'm a heavy mobile app user and I have liked countless numbers of Spotify playlists, but I don't have an easy way of finding and organising them. Instead of users having to do so manually, Spotify could create a separate directory where, every time I like a Spotify playlist, it is automatically saved under it. It could simply be called ""Spotify Playlists"". Currently (as of Spotify for Android version 8.6.88.1104), you can go to Your Library, filter by Playlists and sort by Creator, and scroll down to S to see a list of your saved Spotify playlists. However, the advantage of having a separate directory (in addition to ease of use) is that it would be able to have additional features and sorting capability (e.g. by genre/mood, similar to Liked Songs).",08:52 AM,‎2022-01-04,implemented,102,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Mobile-Your-Library-quot-Spotify-Playlists-quot-folder/idi-p/5322875?search-action-id=347302516555&search-result-uid=5322875,True,"Updated on 2022-10-12 Hey folks,     Thanks for coming to the Spotify Idea Exchange and voting to make this happen.     We're happy to announce that this feature is now available on mobile.     Once again, thanks for helping us make Spotify better, by participating here on the Community.

16,implemented,[Desktop][Playlists] Paste Songs in Playlist at Specific Point,brayden1121,With the new UI update the ability to paste songs at a certain point in a playlist seems to be missing. I have some pretty long playlists that I use custom ordering with. Having the ability to paste songs I recently added to it at a certain point was really helpful. This allowed me to highlight a song near where I wanted the new songs to go and when I pasted the cut songs would be pasted right below it. This saved a lot of time because I didn't need to drag songs from the bottom of the playlist after they were added through the playlist for minutes at a time. This was a great feature and I hope something to replace it or the feature is reinstated. It appears that right now when I try to do this the songs are pasted at the end of the playlist. I have not found a new feature or workaround to this at the moment. This idea implies the existence of the ability to cut rather than just copy songs in a playlist as well so I didn't feel the need to create a separate idea post for that feature. This also doesn't have to be exactly as I described it. A way to move songs to a certain point in a playlist in any way is just what I am looking for.

Read on below. ----- Let spotify know you want this feature back: go to https://support.spotify.com/us/contact-spotify-support/ > Other > I still need help and write to them----- This is a request that Spotify undo their change over the last two weeks to remove the context-menu Playlist radio option from all their platforms. It is NOT sufficient to link to ""Where is Radio?"" https://support.spotify.com/using_spotify/system_settings/why-am-i-seeing-different-features-than-my... - this is not a communications issue, or a learning curve issue. We are asking very precisely that Spotify undo this change. Return the ""Playlist radio"" contextual option in all platforms. We further ask that it return for all objects, i.e all playlists (created by the user or other users), albums, artists etc. Basically: make it like it used to be.The most obvious example is that the create radio playlist option is missing from the right-click context menu on Macos and Windows. But all platforms now make it more difficult to create radio playlists.It disappeared for me on my Mac last week, Windows PC on Monday and Android yesterday.Once you get the update, to create a radio station you now need to go to Radio > Create Radio Station, this will then open a sidebar which you can type the name of your playlist into using your keyboard which will then give you the option to create a radio station. So the feature is effectively buried.I contacted support and they said:At Spotify, we’re often testing and launching improvements and new features. When we’re testing, you may see something on the app your friend doesn’t, or get a new feature for only a temporary period. Let us know what you think over at our Community.Seems like they are following an industry trend of removing features from their service to ""reduce complexity"".

Whilst singing might be fun, I have another approach to lyrics and sound, which is of course not mutually exclusive, and I read the words to see if I like them as I enjoy the melody, if I see myself in the lyrics, if I share the values expressed, and this is easier by having the words at hand. So please Spotify bring back the Lyrics Feature most elegantly -- as you did with restyling the Community -- when you find a better Lyrics Provider.

165,implemented,Cortana integration for Windows 10,benzj,"I think a very great feature for Spotify would be integration for one of Windows 10's most exciting features, Cortana. For example, you should be able to say ""Hey Cortana, play Hold My Hand by Jess Glynne on Spotify"" and it would not only open Spotify, if it wasn't already open, but it would also search through your music (or all of Spotify if needed) for the song (in this case, Jess Glynne's Hold My Hand) and play it. Here are some additional technical thoughts on how this would work:The addition of ""on Spotify"" to the voice command would differentiate requests to play songs from the computer/the default Windows 10 music appTo help streamline the song search process, the command could/would launch a search through Your Music/Songs first before searching all of Spotify, to help reduce the potential to reduce duplicates and the need to mention the artist. For example, if there are multiple songs named ""Next to Me"" on Spotify, but you only have Emeli Sande's song by that title in Your Music, and that is, presumably, the song you're looking for, it would search Your Music, find Emeli Sande's Next to Me first and play that.This feature would make things a lot easier for me, as Spotify is my main music player, and I'd like a quicker way to play songs from Spotify in Windows 10 without having to open the app and look for it myself.",03:40 PM,‎2015-08-03,implemented,953,70,7,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Cortana-integration-for-Windows-10/idi-p/1181504?search-action-id=347302482081&search-result-uid=1181504,True,"Updated on 2018-01-11Hey folks, Cortana + Spotify integration is now live on Win10 releases from RS2 and later.

167,implemented,[Country] Launch Spotify in Romania,thedarq,"I think that given the current alternatives:- Zonga- Deezer- Apple Music (in the not-so-distant future) Spotify would be wasting a chance to get further into the eastern market if it does not launch in Romania as well. There are already a lot of musicians from Romania on Spotify, which means that securing licensing agreements couldn't have been that hard. Furthermore, following the example of deezer which comes bundled with Orange voice contracts, respectively zonga and vodafone, I think that Spotify could seize this opportunity to secure a deal with Telekom and either bundle their services or just outright open here as well. It makes a lot of sense especially since Spotify opened in Hungary and Bulgaria as well. The expansion would only be natural and it would also further drive down the hated piracy phenomenon in the balkans and eastern europe. In the 21th century on a competing market, spotify's ease of use, multiplatform, streaming quality and array of artists would ensure a switch over from the other services to spotify. I was told by a Spotify support representative, a few months back that it is planned to launch Spotify in Romania as well, however, somehow, those plans changed, and the ""official facebook page"" was taken down, and now, the official position is that nobody knows when this is happening. I only want to know the truth, and use this service without resorting to all sorts of loopholes to enjoy it. I think it's time people in my country are treated the same way others are all over europe. There's bad seeds everywhere, but I don't think everyone has to be held accountable for the actions of the few. If you demand respect, you should show respect.

175,implemented,[Desktop] Bring back volume normalization toggle,apecat,"The latest version of the Spotify desktop client [1.0.1.1060.gc75ebdfd] misses the crucial option ""Set the same volume level for all tracks"". It is no longer possible to disable volume normalization. This is downgrade is atrocious. Removing granularity from the options screen and forcing heavy audio processing degrades the value of Spotify to something suitable for non-paid background listening on Bluetooth boomboxes or laptop speakers. While normalization is extremely useful for background music, the option of disabling it improves sound quality, particularly for listening to certain quetly recorded albums and classical music. It's a switch in the UI and should be brought back as soon as possible. It seems to be the case that the normalization toggle never disabled all processing of the audio signal. But the option to disable volume normalization, which was added in early 2009, made the audio quality of Spotify usable for dynamic music and quality gear even before this service offered high bitrate streaming (mid 2009). This setback in audio quality arrives at an unfortunate time when Spotify comptetitors are scrambling to provide lossless, cd-quality streams in several streaming intense markets. It's sad to see Spotify level the playing field by crippling its (partially) native desktop app, which could be a competetive edge. The competition, even the ones aiming for the audiophile crows, typically rely on useless, offline incompatible browser based offerings for desktop and laptop users.Interested parties can participate in this Twitter thread.",07:47 PM,‎2015-03-06,implemented,361,80,8,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Implemented-Ideas/Desktop-Bring-back-volume-normalization-toggle/idi-p/1040449?search-action-id=347302482081&search-result-uid=1040449,True,"2015-05-18 Hey everyone, this feature returned to our Desktop app with the 1.0.5 update.

223,implemented,[All Platforms] Album Art for each Track in a playlist,lamina9,"View as Album List was a great feature. Based on comments I have seen on other forums, I am not the only one who thinks so. Please restore this feature. Reasons: 1) Images are much easier to see than text. I have reached the age of reading glasses. Before this feature was removed, I could easily find songs / albums in playlists. Now I have to find my glasses beforehand! 2) Images are much more compelling and attractive than text. A picture tells a thousand words etc. The whole look and feel of Spotify is enhanced through the use of album images. Removing them seems like going against good user experience practice. 3) Nostalgia. Although I love Spotify and I firmly believe that subscription is the future of music, I still feel some nostalgia for ""possessing"" a collection of albums. Displaying album covers reinforces the feeling of having a collection of albums in a playlist. Note that all three arguments apply equally to desktop and iPad versions of Spotify. November 2013: Response to the comments from Spotify... - There is no need for a cmd+G control. All playlists should always display the album cover. - The Collections product was announced almost a year ago but there is no sign of it. - A Collections product that simply displays the thousands of albums that I have ever listened to is not a viable solution in my opinion.

230,implemented,"Spotify needs to become more Album ""Collection"" based, it's too track-focused at the moment",philask,"Before Spotify I had (well still have, but mostly untouched these days) large MP3 collection organized into Artist/Album/Tracks folder structure. This worked well for me and combined with Playlists meant that I maintained my personal ""collection"" of ""Albums"" as well as favourite tracks and Playlists for particular occasions / moods. What I find these days is that I'm losing track of Albums, I have Spotify Playlists (although the flat Playlist structure tires me), but it's just not the same as having a personalized ""Collection"" of music. Spotify needs to add the ability to build your own ""Collection"" (not Library, which is still track based), this should be organized however you like, but at least providing Artist / Album / Year drill-down structure (folders or not). It'd be nice to match this against existing MP3 collections and Libraries. The ability to tag playlists and collections (and/or albums) would also be a bonus. What I'm getting at here is the missing part (for me) in Spotify is the ability to ""virtualize"" (cloudize?) my mental image of a music collection, which is shelves of albums sorted into some logical order (years, artists, genre, whatever), but mostly Albums, not just Tracks. My 2 cents. UPDATE 21/4/13: I don't seem to be ""allowed"" to embed images in my posts (sad). I've recently been using Google Music on a Nexus 10 and I have to say it has almost the perfect Album / Genre / Artist interface. I particularly love the way that in Artist view you see Albums stacked and they move subtly in 3D as you scroll. The only thing missing here would be Year and latest-added sort/views.

Google just ate your lunch, dinner and breakfast for the next 10 years. Google Play Music All Access has the above functionality (add any album to ""my collection"") and more, including a MUCH better visualization of your collection, album based browsing and a considerably better radio implementation. UPDATE 21/5/13: Spotify ignore albums, again It's pretty obvious now that Spotify have no interest in the albums or the art of constructing an album, don't they realize that most artists work for years to create a ""piece of work"" known as an album, not just a bunch of random tracks? Today Spotify launched their ""Charts"", which once again completely ignore albums... What with Google Play Music All Access and Rdio I think Spotify are going down the slippery fail slope to irrelevance. http://charts.spotify.com/ UPDATE 1/1/14: Looks like Spotify took this suggestion seriously and have been beta testing Collections for quite a while (yes, they made me a beta tester 😉 ) It works well and I'd imagine it'll be mainstream soon.

Tapping either will prompt an Undo option at the bottom of the screen for if you hit it by mistake, or your cat walked over your screen (@dredel)          Tapping Heart will save that song to Your Library, so you can head there to check out all the songs you've liked. This will also include Songs and Albums you've saved in other areas of the app. I couldn't find an idea for a playlist specifically of just liked songs (without the rest of the library) so it would be a good suggestion for a new idea.    I hope this clears some things up.",2019-05-23Hey

One of the things I enjoy about Spotify, is that I get to share music I enjoy, with people all around the world. But how great would it be if it was possible to customize your playlists, to make it your very own. And it doesn't necessary need a lot of advanced or fancy stuff, just your picture of choice for the cover (instead of 4 album covers from your tracklist) and a description box, would be enough to make it kind of original (and make it easier for people to know what kind of music the playlist will include/what it's made for etc.).

Spotify could control it in a few ways: - make the sign up process relatively open - an example is Chrome where users can switch into the beta or even development release channels with a simple software switch - control it by making it invite only based on finding users on the forums who show technical/trouble-shooting ability - an example is Sonos where key members of the community definitely get to test-drive new releases. Spotify could also enforce an NDA on beta users, if it so wished, in order to ensure the general level of secrecy it likes to put around new features - again I'm pretty sure from previous experience that Sonos do this - it was obvious after the release of their Spotify tie-in that some forum users had been in the closed beta.

262,implemented,Group Library by Artist then Album A-Z on the Ipad App,TED209,"There are many similar ideas to this going around but I think this is the easiest way to implement a sensible library management system within spotify, by making changes to the Library system's functionality. It's slightly different to other suggestions which is why I've posted as a new idea. Importantly, this needs to happen on the iPad app. This idea would simply allow people to have a ""traditional"" record collection within Spotify which is what many, if not most users actually want. It is similar (but improved) to the Rdio ""collection."" Functionality Starring a song adds the artist and song to your library Starring an album adds the artist and album to your library Starring an artist adds adds them and all their albums to your library Everything is grouped, first by a user determinable category, then by artist. Artist appears as a 1 line summary. Buttons at the top determine groupings - A-Z then Artist, Genre then Artist, Decade then Artist An A-Z filter allows quick access to Artist and Genre when in that sorting mode. This becomes a timeline in Decade mode. Each time you drill to Artist there is a ""more"" button which links to the Artist Spotify page. Rather than choosing to make all Library tracks offline this is done at Artist, Album and Track levels with a button by the title. The Library system then becomes the ultimate collection management tool and playlists then go back to what they truly should be - mixtapes.

265,implemented,Turn down the volume of loud ads,fractalblaze,"Prevent ads from being louder than the song that came before it. I know the point of the ads is to annoy us into paying up, but it can be very painful to turn on some relaxing tunes after school/work, turn up the volume a bit to hear the quieter details, and then have a surprise advertisement blaring some awful hiphop noise or a screaming spokesman blast 5 times louder than the song. Just normalize the volume of ads so that they aren't louder than the song they follow. Ads should be the same volume as the music. This can be implemented by having an internal variable to measure the average volume within the song, and then set the ad's volume to that **bleep**. This way, classical concertos are recognized at the lower volume they are, and the next ad won't be 5 times louder than the loudest part of the song. Or just have a ""advertisement volume equalizer"" checkbox somewhere in the account settings. Or let us turn up the volume for just one particular quiet song within a playlist, so that everything else plays at normal volume. To all fellow Free users, please take my survey on what you do when an ad is BLASTED at you- I'm sending the responses to the companies being promoted by obnoxious ads, to let them know that loud ads reflect badly on them when we rip off our headphones. Also, contact the companies whose ads are BLASTED at you, and ask them to tell Spotify not to blast their ads. Shari's Berries apologized to us, and a McDonalds rep said they only design ads. Keep it up! Contact the marketing department of these companies and politely ask them to demand a normal volume for their ad.

278,implemented,Implement an actual shuffle function,RoninTheOrigina,"Yes, you read that right. The ""shuffle"" function in Spotify is nothing more than a randomizer. There's a difference? YES. RANDOM - Play one song. The next song can be ANY song in your playlist. Including the one you just listened to. Though I've never had this specifically happen, I literally just heard the same song that I heard 2 songs ago. This is how Spotify's ""shuffle"" currently functions. SHUFFLE - Take your entire list, shuffle them (like cards), and play the first song in the shuffle. Once finished, move that song off the pile. Once the pile is depleted, shuffle the deck again and start over (maybe pop a message up). I know enough about programming (not much) to know that shuffling is probably a bit harder than random, but come on. I may be in the minority, but I don't have a lot of little playlists. I have one list with nearly a thousand songs in it, because I like all the music, and am rarely not in the mood for one of those songs. But what I can't stand is hearing the same song over and over again. I think there may even be songs in my list I haven't heard yet, while I've heard others 4-5 times. I know it may not matter much, but I would probably lay down the money for at least a year subscription if this feature was implemented. EDIT: Another user pointed out that I can see what all is queued up in my shuffle by clicking the Play Queue link, and that Spotify supposedly sets up a rolling shuffle of 50 songs. It would be nice if this range could be expanded to say 50-100% of your playlist. EDIT 4/6/12: I just dealt with the same song 16 tracks later. The song played the first time yesterday afternoon.

Not linking, but displaying the credits along with the album front cover + tracklist by default, in all versions of Spotify. The complete album artwork could still be a Spotify Premium-feature, with this approach.

295,implemented,Make entire play queue editable,Dommedagsprofet,"There's currently two queues in Spotify: The editable queue. (""Queued tracks"")The locked queue. (""Next tracks"")If you press the queue button with tracks in both lists, you can see that these two queues follow each other. The editable queue always plays first. The problem is having a locked queue at all. You can't empty it without interrupting playback, and you'll have to use a workaround to do so. You can't reorder it or add or delete songs. After finishing the editable queue, Spotify always continues playback from the locked queue. The workaround is starting playback at the very last item on a page. The locked queue will then have no further items. Then you can continue by purely using the queue right-click function instead of double-click or enter. This adds items to the editable queue. These tracks can then be reordered and deleted as you wish. This UI behaviour is, however, not very user-friendly and quite frankly really annoying. It's also very unconventional having two queues in a music player. I've never seen any other software using either a dual-queue system or a locked queue system. Here's a good implementation suggestion from user Styrke: ----Google Play Music's queue system is really easy to understand and use. Just do what they do. I can describe it by three (3) easy bullets: Double clicking a song starts playing it and adds the rest of the list that the song came from to the queue.

An example is the game Bastion that was compiled with NaCl to run in Chrome.This would be the easiest way for the Spotify developers, as they only had to tweak their code very little to make it compile with NaCl.

Having a tracker on the outbox would also be useful, to see if they have listened to the song. Perhaps having a feature of a notification if you try to send the same song to a friend twice or another message if they have heard the song in the past, even if you have never sent them it before.

I hate having to place a song in a playlist of its own, and then put it on repeat which just repeats the playlist. People have been suggesting you add this feature for years now! EVERY music app should have this feature! This feature should be on all the Spotify apps across all platforms. Add it to the same button as now with a 3-step repeat mode: 1. Repeat ALL/PLAYLIST 2. Repeat TRACK 3. Repeat OFF My mockup of what this would look like in the iPad app (similar for desktop and other mobile devices): My Comments: If Spotify wants to compete with the competition, they need to add this basic feature! It worries me that Spotify hasn't implemented this popular simple idea from 4 years ago, but instead they implement more complex newer ideas. If you ask some people -- this has been a request since the launch of Spotify. I love Spotify, but it hurts that a simple feature like this gets passed up every time new features are rolled out. I feel like I'm living in the 1990s with no repeat track mode anywhere to be found within Spotify. This is a basic feature and it's being looked at like a grain of salt. I comb through Twitter search every day and a lot of people are very confused on how the repeat mode works so I link them to this idea. I've referred 50+ people now to the link... some didn't know that it only repeated the playlist. This is very confusing for a lot of people, especially newcomers.

335,closed,[Radio] Jazz Fans: Remove the Bird Soundtrack from auto play for Charlie Parker,superreggie,"Jazz is an important genre to Spotify. And Charlie Parker is possibly the greatest of all jazz musicians. Whenever his music comes up in any autoplay situation, very often selections come up from the ""Bird"" soundtrack. All the tracks from the Bird soundtrack have his horn playing lifted out of the original context, and are accompanies by modern musicians. And so they are not actually his music as intended, and certainly sound out of place and different than the actual recordings. This is interesting for a movie, but it is controversial, and it is SUPER annoying if you want to just hear some actual Charlie Parker recordings. That was the kind version. Someone could easily take the approach that this whole approach is an abomination, that it never should have been allowed. I personally don't take it that far, but I do find the recordings really irritating. And for the new listener just trying to discover Charlie Parker's music, this is totally misleading, and even confusing. ""Charlie Parker"" shouldn't even be listed as the artist on this recording I feel, but at very least, it should be taken out of any autoplay algorithms... PLEASE VOTE THIS UP IF YOU AGREE.

341,closed,[All Platforms] No Ads in Podcasts for Spotify Premium users,Montesi,"I pay for my subscription. Every month for years now. The main reason I am a paid-for subscriber with Spotify is so I don't have to hear ads. As I have shifted my podcast listening from other providers to Spotify to bypass ads, both from the platform as well as integrated into the content. I expect not to hear ads on Spotify. I understand there are ads woven into the actual content of the podcast itself, but for as big of a company and the amount of leverage Spotify has, I expect to not hear ads so long as I am paying for the service. I reached out to Spotify and got this lazy, generic answer from Joy in Spotify Customer Support: “if you're hearing ads on podcasts using this Premium account. It's possible that the podcaster integrated that ads to their podcast content”. Thanks for breaking your back on that response. I KNOW what the ads I’m hearing are. And I understand they can’t ask podcasters to export two versions, one with integrated ads and one without. What I expect from Spotify is to either implement metadata that tags the beginning and ending of ad segments and bypass them for us, Premium subscribers, or require podcasters to give metadata timecodes that Spotify can identify to bypass them AUTOMATICALLY. Just to be clear, even if these identifiers are put into the content, I don’t want to have to pull my phone out to hit any sort of “skip ads” button. This is literally the ONLY reason users have Premium. So get rid of the ads. It’s actually very simple. And let’s not get started on how archaic it is to continually hit the “15sec forward” button to bypass the ads, first over shooting, then undershooting the duration of the integrated ad, only to have to make peace with hearing the last ten seconds of the ad. At that point it’s not servicing either party in the transaction. It’s 2020. You are a huge company with a lot of leverage and a huge developer budget. I honestly can’t believe I’m even having to write this suggestion. tl:dr - Spotify, I am a Premium member. You made a promise to me that if I became a Premium member, I wouldn’t hear ads. I’m hearing ads on podcasts. Integrated or not, I don’t care. You have the technology and power to fix it. So fix it. And make it automatic.

Here are some suggestions to enhance the live session experience for both hosts and followers:Notification to Followers: When a user starts a live session, it would be great if their followers could receive a notification about it. This would help increase engagement and make it easier for followers to join the live session and interact with the host.Chatting and Commenting: Adding a chat or comment box during the live session would enable users to discuss the songs being played or share their comments. This would foster interaction and create a sense of community among the participants, making the live session more engaging and enjoyable.Song Recommendations: Allowing followers to recommend songs during the live session would make the experience more inclusive and interactive. It could also provide the host with new song suggestions and keep the session fresh and dynamic.Like Button: Similar to the feature in Instagram Live, a like button would allow users to express their appreciation for the host's performance or a particular song. This would provide feedback to the host and encourage them to continue delivering a great live session.Microphone Option for the Host: Giving the host the option to use a microphone to speak or announce songs would add a personal touch to the live session. It would also enable hosts to make transitions between songs or engage with their audience in a more interactive way.Overall, I believe that incorporating these features would make the live session feature on Spotify more interactive and enjoyable.

This is very frustrating to me. There is this thing called ""Backward Compatibility"" that we use to have in the IT world. For example, MS-DOS still works on modern computers and the latest versions of Java still runs the oldest Java applications. IBM mainframes are backward compatible. Sun Microsystems' hardware was backward compatible. But, we seem to be losing it these days. For example, newer versions of Python break the old code. The developers of Python are making a lot of unnecessary work for their users. You can still fix security issues in your older clients without totally breaking their functionality. You can version your protocol so that you can detect which version of the client is connecting and run the old version of the server for that client. There are so many options to allow older clients to work. It doesn't have to involve a lot of extra work on your part just to leave older versions of your server available for the client to connect to. I also have older Macs on which Spotify no longer works. This is also very frustrating to me. There is a whole community of people that like to use their older Macs that are frustrated that Spotify does not work on their hardware. Those older Macs are perfectly capable of running Spotify, you're just choosing not to to allow it. I just want to ask you to please stop breaking older versions. Invest in backward compatibility.

381,closed,[ALL PLATFORMS][MUSIC] Custom start and end times for each song,MarkV68,"There needs to be more than just a general crossfade. Some songs have a COLD OPEN OR COLD ENDs and with the crossfade active on a song that has a traditional fadeout into a song with a COLD OPEN, you miss the opening lyrics of the COLD OPEN song.Conversely, when a song has a COLD END, you're fading in a song in the background with no ability to bring it in at a specific time.And the BIGGEST trainwreck is a COLD OUT to a COLD OPEN. Being able to mark in and out on songs adds to the flow of a playlist, especially a party/dance playlist.EXAMPLE: You Oughta Know-Alanis Morissette, COLD OPEN. If the previous song fades out, you miss the open lyrics. Yes, you could have a short crossfade, but the previous song may go to almost silence before starting this song. And that would only apply to that one segue. Or how about the COLD OUT of Love Runs out-One Republic? I longer crossfade would bring in the next song early and cause this song to fade out instead. Go with a short crossfade and this song ends and the next song may start with a long silent intro making for bad song transitions. These are all types of trainwrecks that kill mood and flow.Thanks Spotify team.

I think if my company put out an invite link to a “Listeners Group” we could all join, see what we are all listening to at any moment while people are in the group, and listen along to anyone of our choice. Another good example would be an influencer making a group and fans could all listen to similar music together, they could come into the group, look at what people are listening to and join in on somebody else in the group.The convenience factor of this update would be allowing someone to create a link and posting it publicly inviting everyone to the organization’s group, and showing the people in the group by name, and what they are listening to.

407,closed,[Mobile][Discover] Location Based Artists / Song Suggestions,KuyaKale,"Hello, my name is Kyle. I have an idea to implement a feature that allows users to discover music within the area / location they are in. For instance, if a user happens to be in the city of Philadelphia, this feature will recommend songs that are being listened to in the Philadelphia region and nearby areas up to an X-mile distance, whether it be popular mainstream songs, or smaller artists. Meanwhile, users presently on the West Coast will discover artists in the regions they are presently in (i.e., Bay Area versus Los Angeles region-based music). The idea here is that the song / artist suggestions provided to the user are driven by what the residents of the particular area are listening to. The benefits I see here are: - This could potentially help local artists get discovered. Whereas trending local artists have historically gained their followings through word-of-mouth, this idea states that through 1st party data collection and geo-targeting, users will get recommended music that residents of the area are listening to. Local, community-driven artists with smaller followings will experience increased exposure as both visitors and born-and-bred natives seek to discover new artists or releases by established artists from those areas. - Avid travelers will gain firsthand exposure to trending music in their areas. We can all agree that music has roots-- ties to its artists' origins both figuratively and geographically. This feature would add to users' traveling experience, providing them with new music from those areas to discover, while simultaneously giving artists and creators increased potential to get discovered (tying back to the first point). Thank you for taking the time to consider this idea-- I believe this could be a beneficial feature for listeners and creators alike. I look forward to hearing back from your team.

445,closed,[Mobile][Social] Sending Songs / Mailbox,planetfenix,"Problem #1: Many users (such as myself) are sent songs from friends via Spotify link in imessages, this often takes place at inopportune times; the message gets lost in the chat and the user never returns to listen to the song. Spotify should have an additional full menu that acts as a mailbox similar to Instagram's direct messages. That being said, there should be a few MORE features than Instagram's DMs to promote user engagement with Spotify. The Mailbox should have the following features: - Can send Followers songs - Users can react to songs with similar reactions as apple's imessages reactions (thumbs up, thumbs down, heart, and laugh) - I would suggest mailbox should not have the ability to send users chat messages due to safety concerns- reactions only. - Optional toggle setting to let friends know when you have listened to their song (similar to Read receipts) - Artists can blast send all Followers their new music. This makes fans more likely to interact with the songs and have it sitting in their 'mailbox' instead of being notified once in the app about a new release.- Users should have a toggle setting to turn this feature on and off in case they do not want artists to send them new songs - Songs in the mailbox end up in a Spotify-generated playlist of Received Songs similar to other spotify-generated playlists such as Episodes. Users have the option of removing songs from this playlist if desired. This change could lead to a significant boost in user engagement with Spotify and would promote users to use Spotify to send songs instead of going outside to other sources such as Youtube. Users would have more of a draw to use Spotify as they would see songs in their Mailbox and be enticed to listen to them on their own time.

452,closed,[Playlists] Tethering,Balty89,"Often times, Albums are not only made, but constructed specifically and meticulously. Producers like Metro Boomin', most notably with his hit Superhero on HEROES & VILLAINS, has a track at the beginning of his album called On Time. On Time is borderline a prelude to what is really the titular track Superhero. But this premise can be found in many Albums (and not specific to the beginning of the album, but really, songs with seamless transitions into the next song), Jaden Smith's B, L, U, E, The Weeknd's How Do I Make You Love Me going into his single Take My Breath, with many more examples. Tethering, as it applies to playlists, is a toggle-based feature, that can 'tether' two, or more, songs together. When the playlist is put into shuffle, songs that are tethered, will always play in order, and in sequence. If a user were to tether Jaden Smith's B L U E, then when the shuffle gets to the Tethered Grouping, it will play all in sequence, IF the tether has been activated. Seeing as BLUE is a collection of 4 songs, putting them in a shuffle is risky business, as the user might hear U before B or vice versa. With an option for tethering, the user has the opportunity to listen until satisfied, and can promptly skip when necessary, if at all.",04:14 PM,‎2023-03-31,closed,2,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Playlists-Tethering/idi-p/5531746,True,"Updated on 2023-04-11Hello @Balty89!Thanks for bringing your ideas to the Community.

456,closed,[Podcasts] DISABILITY as a Podcast Category with Subcategories,atypicaltruth,"Hello,Currently, there are 19 primary categories and 91 subcategories for podcasts and disability is not included in any of these. Disability-themed podcasts are spread out into a variety of categories that do not exactly fit nor represent the content. Even in the primary categories of ""Health & Fitness,"" disability is not an option amongst alternative health, fitness, medicine, nutrition, mental health, and sexuality. The lack of disability as a category or even a subcategory for podcasts mirrors a critical problem in our society - ableism. Creating a podcast category for “disability” helps the disabled community in several ways:1) it makes it easier to find podcasts relating to disability, therefore, more accessible to those who are searching them out2) it helps disability podcast creators to be more discoverable to the demographic of people who are searching it out Being disabled has historically been stigmatized and those within disabled community are working to change that. We are a large community - disability does not discriminate, it impacts every other identity factor: race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, and socio-economic status.

462,closed,[iOS][Developer] Spotify- Improving interface when listening to songs on IOS.,EmBake1204,"Disclaimer- I have an i phone 13 (IOS) and these comments are some improvements for the interface of the Spotify app. Thanks for reading! 1. Spotify should include the year a songs/ album was released when listening to a song. When you are listening to a song on spotify there is song/ album title, artist name, and time-matched lyrics, but not the release year. If I really like a song it would be great if the release year was written right there so I don't have to go to safari to look up the album information. 2. Also, when listening to a song there should be a hyperlink on the Artist's name so you can click the artist's name and be directed right to their Spotify page with their songs/discography/ albums etc. This would be easier than going back to search and trying to type in their name and find more of thier music. 3. When you bring the lyrics to full screen the forward/reverse skip button are no longer shown. Only the play/pause and progress bar of the song is shown when lyrics are in full screen mode. Because of this you have to minimize lyrics and go back to the album screen to use the skip and shuffle buttons. It would be a more streamline interface if the skip and repeat/shuffle options were still available when in full screen lyrics mode.

519,closed,[Desktop][Search] Podcast search within a playlist,CourteousCain,"Currently, the ability to search for episodes within a Podcast is very limited. On the Android Mobile app, you can search for a keyword in a podcast playlist, but it will not show all results in that playlist (it only goes back a period of time, not since the podcast playlist's creation). On the Windows 10 desktop app, there is no feature at all to search within a Podcast. CTRL+F does not work in the app. On the Website, you can use CTRL+F to search, but it only loads a limited number of episodes at a time, so using that search feature is very clunky. In addition, when the webpage gets reloaded, you have to go back down through all the results and load all the episodes you want to search within again.You can search from the basic ""Search"" function and search for a Podcast name and the title, but you only see very few Episode results, and you can't see all results for that. It's a very clunky and terrible experience trying to search through podcasts. The search feature for songs is implemented great - why is the experience for podcasts so awful?

563,closed,[Desktop] Social Feed Interaction,ashklunk,"This is an idea that has a wide spread, so it's hard to specify one exact action within the app. I want to preface this by saying that the social aspect of Spotify makes it unique and well-loved by myself and all of my friends and family. The ability to interact with each other through shared playlists, and to be able to see what everybody is listening to live in the app is what we love the most. It turns our personal music library and listening habits into something that we can share, which is exactly what music is about. Sharing and connecting. Spotify is the app for real music lovers. Right off the bat, I know that the idea of any further interaction between users than you already have would start to seem goofy, but you also might want to appreciate how goofy your average playlist-maker, music geek, at-home DJ really is. We really love the fact that that Spotify can connect us with our people musically, especially in a time when people are doubting how genuine social media is...sharing the music we love with others always feels authentic. Currently, you can see a feed of your Facebook friends and what they're listening to in the Spotify app if you have linked the apps together. It is almost like a tease, in as much as you can see these people and what they're listening to yet you can't interact or weigh in at all. It's hard to think of a way to let users interact with each other without opening a huge can of worms, I can see that. I would like to recommend a few ideas that might work. 1) ""Friend Recommendations""You could create a default playlist on everybody's account that was called ""Friend Recommendations"". You could create a function on every individual profile that allowed others to ""recommend"" music to other users in the same way the app allows us to add songs and albums to our own playlists, or in the way it allows us to see other users playlists and save them. This could keep people using the app longer because they're exploring and diving deep for the sake of sharing with friends and family. Imagine high schoolers and their crushes...this could be the new generation's burnt CD mix. Especially if they could do it in real time. Music is a language we ALL communicate with. 2) ""Alerts"" for Social InteractionCreating an in-app alert for Spotify is obviously a huge departure from the kind of app you are, I'm sure you don't want to be an intrusive overly-social app. However, in the same way many apps are launching ""live sessions"", or ""group sessions"" or ""watch parties"", you could have an option available for users to choose to be updated immediately when other users send them music in the app or not. You could have it become an option in the ""queue"" as it were, like, ""your friend things you should put this on next"". You could keep the queue open for your friends. It would be just like how you can currently choose a private or public listening session. That's all I really have to say! I hope you can appreciate what I as a user would love to have, and I do think many people who use this app would find fun and connection in it. I think your app is already smooth enough to add anything else you want without harming the core function. I mean, you certainly have the talent, budget, and user base to get bigger and better!",10:54 AM,‎2023-03-28,closed,0,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Desktop-Social-Feed-Interaction/idi-p/5529201,True,"Updated on 2023-03-30Hello @ashklunk!Thanks for coming to the Ideas Exchange.

577,closed,[Other] Spotify Mini (iPod Nano/Shuffle for Spotify),Penutbuttrr,"The generations that use Spotify the most right now are the ones that have extreme nostalgia for the iPod nano and all of the portable music devices. I guarantee you that people would have brought them back if it wasn't for two things.1. BluetoothBluetooth was one of the biggest changes to music. Not having the ability to use your airpods or new Bluetooth headphones with an iPod nano is such a detriment. No one wants to go back to using chorded headphones, they want the ease of Bluetooth.2. The change in purchasing music:No one buys music anymore, and that's because of you. Music streaming is how almost everyone listens to music now. Not being able to access your music streaming on an iPod nano is THE reason as to why it has no been brought back like records have. But I present to you the Spotify Mini. With the incredible development of technology within the past decade. Making a device the size of the iPod nano/shufle has so much potential. I propose that you create a device akin to the iPod Shuffle/Nano but with 3 major improvements.1. Increased StorageThe amount of data that we can store in small spaces has skyrocketed since the iPod came out, and the amount that we can store within the small constraints of an iPod Nano is more than enough for all your music needs.2. Bluetooth compatibility.This is an obvious one. Let the device connect via spotify and you're good to go.3. SPOTIFYNow yeah this is obvious, but this device uses Spotify! It will connect to your account through whatever device you choose that you are logged in on, and it has full access to all your playlists and liked songs as long as you have access to wifi. You can download playlists just like you can on your phone, and you can play them whenever, wherever, with such a tiny device. Now finally, why do this at all?Like I said before, the generation that is using Spotify the most are ones that used the iPod nano and shuffle during their childhood. And with this huge nostalgia boost that has been happening recently, recreating this revolutionary device for modern trends and applications would be HUGE. Besides the nostalgia though, the device alone is incredibly useful. For exercising, people will no longer need to take their phone just for music, they can take this small device that can clip to their pants or rest in their pocket with barely any weight and have access to any podcast or playlist they desire without the inconvenience of their oversized phone. I know I got a bit passionate about this, and I'm honestly not sure if anyone will end up reading this. But hopes to one day this reaches someone who can make something really cool.

Often lyrics and melodies are just repeating over and over and a song that makes joy for the first maybe 2:30 minutes, gets too long while going on until the end after 4, 5 or more minutes. It would be great to have an option to limit the length of songs. After this time, just the next song in the queue shall be played.(in future maybe even with an algorithm choosing automatically a passage within the song to end it).The only similar topic I could find here in the community is:https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Music-Custom-Start-amp-Ending-Times-for-a-Track/idi-p/40...

611,closed,[Desktop][Other] better embed support for discord and external websites,AlexSquibbs,"in discord, when a user sends a spotify link, an embed for that link will appear in the desktop app in which users can interact with and listen to music with. problem with this is that these embeds treat all users as if they are guests, and that leaves users only getting preview audio rather than the full spotify embed experience. as i have seen with the spotify embeds on my website, users who have not logged into spotify on that browser will get preview audio, while users who have logged into spotify on that browser will get the full audio experience. even if you link your spotify and discord accounts, you will still get treated as a guest user and will get the preview audio, while people who have linked their spotify and discord accounts seem to have the opportunity to be able to play the full audio from the embed. my second part of this is that i suggest the feature to show that embeds are currently playing in the spotify app (desktop/mobile/web/etc), so that users know where the audio source is coming from and can control it. i suggest maybe making the audio source either like the domain name of the website, or whatever is in the websites <title> html tag. for now, spotify just pauses in the player and plays whatever is in the embed without really letting the user know in the app that it is in fact playing from another source (the embed). another part of this that links with the first part, is that the same thing should occur for discord embeds, but this time just mark the audio source as like ""Discord"". lastly, maybe speak with discord about having their desktop app check if spotify is installed (or running if you want to do that instead), and if so, redirect directly from discord to the spotify app rather than opening a browser page. back on 2/13/2022, i made a discovery that linkages from spotify from the discord desktop app will directly go to the spotify mobile app if the user has the spotify android app installed via windows subsystem, rather than going to a browser page to display. its really cool that this already happens with the spotify android app via windows subsystem for android, but it would be even cooler if this were to happen with the native windows spotify desktop app as well since most people arent gonna have spotify for android installed on their computer sorry that this is a ton to digest, but i just felt like i wanted to share this because i think it would make spotify feel more user friendly and just more ""smooth"" and ""connected"" if you know what i mean 😉",12:37 AM,‎2023-03-27,closed,0,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Desktop-Other-better-embed-support-for-discord-and-external/idi-p/5528365,True,"Updated on 2023-03-28   Hey @AlexSquibbs,   Thanks for bringing your feedback to the Idea Exchange.     We’re closing this idea since it doesn’t meet one of our Idea Exchange guidelines, namely “One change request per Idea.”   We appreciate your elaborate idea, however, when one post includes several feature requests, it becomes hard to keep track of and update them.   If you have more than one idea, you can make a new idea submission for each one.

618,closed,Limit songs that appear on curated playlists & encourage new artists on curated playlists,SlugWheeler,"I love the concept that Spotify curates playlists for me based on music I’ve liked or played. Currently, however, Spotify’s curated playlists are NOT doing what I most want from third party input: I want a fresh, new, different perspective on music so that I can discover new songs and, especially, new artists. Currently, Spotify’s curated playlists annoy me because they just regurgitate the same songs I’ve already listened to and, for that very reason, those songs are no longer interesting or enjoyable to me. With that said, I have two suggestions for Spotify:1) Have a way for Spotify users to select the “type” of curated playlists that they want to receive, with options such as: “new artists only,” “new music only,” “a mix of only new artists and new music,” “a mix of 75% new artists/music and 25% ‘loved’ music,” “a 50-50 mix of new artists/music and ‘loved’ music,” or “only a mix of ‘loved’ music and artists I’m following.”Another feature that Spotify could add that would somewhat address my concern stated above is to…2) Add a feature that would allow Spotify users to limit how often songs appear on their curated playlists. For example, users could set preferences that would limit songs from appearing on their curated playlists to no more than X number of times during an X week/month/year period. So if I had this ability, again for example, I would set my preferences to limit any song from appearing on my curated playlists to no more than once during a one week period AND no more than 3 times within a 5 week period. This suggestion gets at my being tired of hearing the same music over and over, which would be nice.

660,closed,Songs are being removed from my library?,ignis_fatuus,"(defaulted to wrong forum; repost) I'm going to copy/paste user 2Madi's post form another thread (the query was inexplicably closed) because they sum up the issue pretty well and it's been driving me crazy for a year now: ""On many occations i've noticed that some songs that I have on my playlist aren't there anymore. I have one main playlist with all the songs that I like and sometimes I add songs to the playlist to make sure that I have them there, expecting to see the notification pop up where it says that the song is already there and ask if I want to skip duplicates but it doesn't and I am 100% sure that i've had that song in the playlist before and listened to it in this playlist specifically.I have searched for the song in the playlist to see if I have it but from another album because that happens sometimes but a lot of times I don't have the song at all even though I am 100% certain that it's supposed to be there. I've noticed as well that my old playlist that I had years ago had over 2000 songs but now it only has 1000. Can it have something to do with spotify changing the directories of the songs like if the song is in an album they remove the single and if I have the single in my playlist it gets removed? Or if an artist release a deluxe version of an album and spotify removes the regular album because it doesn't need to be there anymore when the deluxe album is there and better, and if I have songs on my playlist from that album they will be removed from my playlist? That's my theory but I don't know, all I know is it's very annoying.Does anyone know the reason or if there is any way to solve it?Thanks!""

683,live,[All Platforms] Allow “hide song” function to sync across ALL devices and ALL playlists,HumbleRoJo,"I often use my iPad, via mobile hotspot, as a “remote control” for the Spotify app running on my iPhone (which has the data plan). This allows me to switch tracks, like music, etc. while working on the iPad without having to use my limited mobile hotspot data. However, “hiding” a track from a list (daily mix, radio etc.) does not transfer from the iPad’s playlist to the current playlist running on the iPhone. Therefore, ”hide song” also does not force a skip to the next track. Similarly, hidden tracks on the iPhone are not displayed as such on the iPad. This makes curating lists of music using multiple devices frustrating at best. It’s important to note that “liking” a track does in fact immediately sync to the other devices and therefore hiding a track should also be possible. Thank You. Add on: Also, please fix “hide song” so that it syncs to all playlists throughout my account. If I don’t want to hear a song, I NEVER want to hear it again.

688,live,[All Platforms] [Podcast] Individual Autoplay Settings,poplopo,"I think Podcasts should have different settings for autoplay than music. With music, the most desired way to listen is to proceed to the next song automatically without having to select one. But that's not the way podcasts are generally consumed - it is a more deliberate process. And particularly because the default sorting of a podcast is to display them with the most recent podcast first, it's quite a disruption to listen to a podcast all the way through and it begins to play the ""next"" episode - which also happens to be an older one that you've probably already listened to. There should be a setting that users can select to only play one podcast at a time.

This is pretty common for songs released first as a single then within an album. For example, if you like the single one, the UI will not show the song as liked when you browse the album. And if you like the song in the album, you'll end up with a duplicated version in your library. This also happens a lot for songs that you listen in Daily Mix or Discover weekly. If it's not the exact same song you have already liked before, the UI is inconsistent and you can save a duplicate. Apparently, there is already an internal merge mechanism as the play counter is not split between the different versions of the songs. Maybe this can also be used to consolidate the UI.

693,live,[All Platforms] Option to have a true shuffle.,jonathanleyerle,"So I’ve been noticing more and more recently that Spotify’s default shuffle feature doesn’t fully shuffle your songs. It does some sort of grouping to try to get similar songs together based off of what I’m sure is dozens of factors. Every time I shuffle a playlist (the one I noticed this with the most is ~100 songs and 6 hours of mostly full albums) it will group the songs mostly or completely together by album/artist, and given the number of times I’ve re-shuffled and checked the order there’s no way it’s just a coincidence. They also generally seem to be in the same order as well. If I hit shuffle play on a playlist it’ll generally put the same artists at the beginning every time. With larger playlists of albums I am really not a fan of this shuffling method. If I have 6 hours of music on a playlist I will hardly ever have 6 hours to actually listen through the whole thing, but when I do listen to it I would like to hear all of the music on it equally, and not just the artist or two your algorithm likes to shuffle to first. Anyways, I’m a reasonable man, all I’m asking for is an option to have a true shuffle (take all songs in the list, put them in a random order, and once they’re all played reshuffle them and play them again). Make it premium only if you want. I don’t think you should scrap the current shuffle algorithm because it sucks. Looking at some of the suggestions on here it seems like some people lobbied hard to have it that way. Just add an option for a true shuffle for those of us that don’t care about potentially getting the same song twice in a row.",05:00 AM,‎2020-01-06,live,2074,860,86,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/All-Platforms-Option-to-have-a-true-shuffle/idi-p/4880594,True,"Updated on 2021-09-14Hey everyone,   Thanks for your votes and for bringing us your feedback in the Spotify Idea Exchange.   As this idea has gathered a fair amount of votes, we've discussed it with the relevant team once again.

713,live,[Playlists] Ability to link together Tracks in Playlists,bvacaliuc,"Hi, Wouldn't it be great if you could ""pair""/""link""/""lock"" or ""chain"" tracks together in a playlist? Then even if you shuffle-played, certain songs would always play together. mock-up of how linking/pairing a song might work. This idea was actually started by @Sartoris in 2012: https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Ability-to-link-together-tracks-in-playlists-also-for-... But in 2015 it was closed as not having enough votes. Coincidentally, about the same time, I signed up for Spotify premium. As I listened to all the songs I've ""liked"" with shuffle, the one thing that kept coming into my mind was the terrible feeling you get when a song that is meant to follow another is not played. You get the feeling of being violated; it is a terrible experience. As I searched for this feature, I saw that idea was marked inactive and decided to open it again. That idea had gotten 138 likes in 2015 and as of January 2020 has gotten another 116 for a total of 255. There were another 18 ideas then that all linked to the one above (see attached). So I re-submitted this idea in 2015 and since then you wonderful people have given it over 880 votes! Thank you! From the rules, we see that we needed to have over 500 votes to keep the topic alive in monthly discussions (check!). We also see that we need 100 votes per year to keep it alive (check again!). So we're in good shape on that front. Now we have to see what we need to do to get it moving forward from ""Not Right Now"" to ""Under Consideration"". Again, from the rules above, Spotify says that they use these criteria:Helping artists.Data and other information we've collected.Information from research testing, focus groups, and surveys.Feedback in the Community and other support channels. (That's us!)Our overall short- and long-term business strategy.Hmm. Ok. So I would say that playing tracks that are meant to be together really helps the artists because their work is rendered in the correct way that they intended. I'm wondering how many artists are dying inside when their specially arranged songs are cut up because someone shuffled their playlist? I can't speak to Spotify's data and research, focus groups and surveys, or about their business strategy. However, it occurs to me that anything that affects the order of which song plays can affect revenue because Spotify pays someone when a song gets played and they don't pay the same amount of $ for every song... Sure its a tiny fraction of a cent, but it adds up. So my first guess is that Spotify's hesitation to implement this idea is economic. I think we should continue the discussion along these lines to see if we could come up with some kind of consensus on this notion. Letting a song ""pair"" with another in a playlist would be enough to make a lot of people happy. Would we be willing to put some $ behind having this feature? Lets say Spotify charged you $0.01 (a cent) everytime you were shuffle playing and the queue hit a linked song and played the one that came after it. Would you be ok with that? If not, what would make it ok? I think answering the economic question is one thing that is keeping this idea from moving forward. @wsmyth commented in May 2019 that he would be willing to spend $1/month for this feature. I would do that too, would you? From the many, many great comments, @WesleyM77 posted in April 2019 a link to a US Patent. There are two patents, actually, [US8214740B2] and [US9396760B2]. Reading through the two patents, it's clear that they cover this idea in many of its possible methods. So apart from the economic impact, Spotify may be prevented by the patent holder from implementing this feature. It has been noted that only one service has this feature, and now this explains it. The patents expire in 2030. So, here we are. We want a feature, someone has successfully patented the feature and so we can't have nice things. Everyone including the patent holders want to make money, so is there a price that Spotify could negotiate with the patent holder and then pass on to the users that would be acceptable to all parties? Spotify, would you look into this and get back to us?

I use to be able to click that line and then shuffle play all 30 songs. But starting recently only the 10 liked songs will play.

This can be a problem when having a party and a track lasts for 7 minutes with 3 of them is a buildup that not everyone would like to listen to. It would be nice to have a feature like this that i can change on each track, just drag 2 buttons to a start and end point. and maybe have a 3-5 second fade on where i choose to set them.

731,live,[iOS] Bring back Chronological Scroll,koorscolors,"In the new version of Spotify (with DJ, smart shuffle) I noticed that the ability to scroll quickly and chronologically was gone from ‘liked songs’. While those other features are awesome; I really miss this scrolling feature and I am unsure why it was removed. There are two reasons I feel this should be brought back:1. Scrolling chronologically (ie with the date and a scrollbar) allowed me to quickly find music. For example, I flew to the Philippines in summer 2019 and there was a song I listened to constantly; the name of which I cant quite remember. I could quickly find it based on my memory of a date and event in my life.2. This scrolling feature allowed me to scroll quickly on mobile. Without it, if I want to navigate to the bottom of my liked songs list, I have to scroll with my finger for way to long until it almost physically hurts.

739,live,[iOS][Other] We should have the option to enable the spotify widget on lockscreen,inkaokarina,"I think we should have the option to enable the spotify widget that is showed on your phone lockscreen whenever spotify is in use. I personally have accidentally skipped and paused songs multiple times because of this widget. Whenever you are on a walk or at the gym, you may have your phone in your hand or your pocket. If you have an iPhone, your phone probably turns on when the screen is touched and because the pause/skip buttons are in the middle of the screen, you may accidentally skip the song you were listening to. I also find it annoying that anyone who can see your lockscreen can see what you're listening to even when the phone is locked. So even without knowing your passcode or face ID (on iPhone) people can still see what you are listening to for example while checking the time on your phone.

752,live,[Mobile][Other] Play button on Artist Page should play only songs by that particular artist,The-Husk,"I noticed this recently with the mobile app while playing songs on Slipknot's artist page, when all of the sudden a song by Murderdolls, a side-project by one of Slipknot's members Joey Jordison, started playing.

754,live,"[Mobile] Please bring back the old group session. ""Play from same device""",tgerhardt1,"The old group session, ""play from same device option"" has been removed and it has saddened many people. It seems the only group session option is now remote group sessions, where the music is played on each individual device. This group session, ""play from same device"" feature was personally one of my favorite features of Spotify. When it was first introduced, I quite literally showed all of my friends to use it. I understand it was in beta, but this feature was used by many people, quite literally all the time. We know this feature did not work perfectly, but we would use it regardless of the tiny flaws, it was honestly my favorite thing about Spotify. Whenever I, or any group, would have friends over, I would always offer to start a group session so that everyone could contribute to the music being played. Having this option, friends could seamlessly contribute to the music being played so that one person would not selfishly play music the entire time. It was so fun having everyone able to contribute, without having to hand over the one single phone to everyone that was connected to the device, just to add a few songs to the queue. Having someone scan a code and then instantly able to add songs to the queue was a perfect idea for hanging out with friends, in person. It appears with the new update, there is only an option for remote group sessions where the music is played on each individual device, I'm asking to consider bringing back the ""play from same device."" To recap, this feature allowed people to share music during in-person hang sessions, and from the people I had introduced to it, all found it to be one of the most fun features of Spotify.

760,live,Albums & Playlists: Have BOTH Play & Shuffle buttons at the top,MattSuda,"Albums and Playlists should have BOTH a Play Button and a Shuffle Button at the top in the mobile and desktop apps Some users want to easily play the list in order and other users want to play it in shuffle. Some buttons are currently play and some are shuffle. Why not put both buttons there so we can choose if we want to shuffle it or play it? Right now to play in order you can press or click on the first item in the list, but with the different types of play buttons this is still confusing for most users. Shuffle can also be controlled by clicking on the shuffle button on the now playing screen. Right now the play buttons are inconsistent across all of the Spotify apps. On mobile it was recently changed so now when you go to album pages, the button at the top is no longer a shuffle play button but instead a regular play button. Playlists still have the shuffle play button on mobile. On desktop all play buttons are regular play buttons and do not shuffle. See how confusing that is? Why not do like other music apps already do and have both a PLAY and SHUFFLE option buttons at the top of the playlist or album. Problem solved, you get to pick how you want to play it. Doesn't make sense how inconsistent it is currently. I never use the play buttons because you never know if it's going to shuffle or regular play. I just click the first song in the list to play the songs in order usually and if I want to shuffle I just turn shuffle on from the now playing view. For artist pages you can just leave it the way it is now with only a shuffle play button since playing in order wouldn't make sense. You could still add it and pressing the play button would play their most recent releases in order. If you end up keeping the shuffle button then change the icon on it to a shuffle instead of the play with the little shuffle icon underneath it. This is how it would look like at the top of the album and playlist pages in the mobile app. It would look similar in the desktop app too.

""Your Episodes"" is the same for podcasts.Other playlists (and podcasts) are sort-able in a variety of ways. But these are pinned right at the top. For those of us that don't use spotify that way (even if spotify would like for us to do so), it would be better if the ""liked songs"" playlist was treated like all the other playlists and could be sorted down alphabetically or recently played or custom (same for ""your episodes""). I don't need (strangely larger than normal) empty playlists or folders right at the top of my library. If you don't want to let us delete them (or just have them not appear unless there is something in there) it seems like at the very least they should be sort-able like every other playlist. Even for those who really like and use these categories, the option to sort would still allow them to keep them pinned right at the top as they are now. (it should be down under ""L"" if I select this)(I don't know what this would do for me - make it disappear altogether?) (this would result it in being placed down at the bottom, since I don't use it). I thought maybe this was a bug when the update happened some time back, but it's apparently by design. It just doesn't make sense to me that we'd be forced to keep an empty playlist with an enormous icon pinned at the top of the library that I have to just scroll past every time I try to select a playlist.

812,live,[Playlists] Solution to false/abusive reporting,CloudlightRec,Whenever someone reports a playlist - the title and cover art are removed immediately. This is often abused to hurt record labels and playlist curators. After contacting support - the account of someone who abused this system gets taken down. This person then creates another email and free Spotify account and repeats the process. There is a simple solution to the problem - enable reporting feature only after 10 hours of music/podcasts were streamed using the account. It won't change the experience for a normal user but makes copyright abuse impractical. It's cheap and easy to implement and would stop 95% of false claims.

815,live,AI DJ needs to be able to tailor music playlists to activity,129502195,The AI DJ is great in giving the listener a complete selection of different music from past and present artists. Love the concept. I suggest that when the DJ starts that an activity screen or the DJ asks what activity the listener is doing during that time. The music playlist then can be tailored to that activity. The DJ played some great relaxed chill music when I was working out but that music was not what I was wanting during that time. I pressed the DJ button to change the playlist. Now when I am relaxing I am not getting any chill music due to my changing the playlist. I think having the ability to have music specifically for certain activities will enhance the experience. Have the DJ mode be able to change playlists also when the activity changes.

816,live,[Podcasts] Auto-Updating Podcast Playlists/Routines,RedRoevr,"Every morning, I have a number of daily news podcasts that I enjoy listening to in the same order every time. The way I currently go about this routine is by starting to play the latest episode from the first podcast, then adding the latest episode of the second and third (and so on...) podcasts to the que so they play in the order I choose. This feels pretty tedious, so I attempted to create a playlist with these podcasts in the order I like to listen to them everyday. However, I seem to only be able to add specific episodes to the playlist, not the show itself. Which means I can create the perfect playlist for THIS morning, but by TOMORROW morning it will not have updated to the latest episodes and be out of date. And so, therein lies my idea... The ability to create an auto-updating playlist of podcasts (not podcast episodes) in the order I choose. I see it resembling something like the ""Routines"" one can set on the Amazon Alexa app. For example, when a particular custom phrase is spoken, a preset number of actions occur in the order they were set. Translated to Spotify: You press the play button on a podcast playlist, and a preset selection of latest episodes play in the order they were set. Similar to the ""Daily Drive"" playlist, but with the ability to customize exactly what I want to hear. Based on how I like to use Spotify, this idea being implemented would significantly improve my ease of use and enjoyment of the app. Thanks for reading.",01:02 AM,‎2023-04-01,live,102,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Podcasts-Auto-Updating-Podcast-Playlists-Routines/idi-p/5532000,True,Updated on 2023-04-11Hey!

820,live,[iOS][Developer] Apple Watch Needs Standalone Spotify App(Needs votes),nkittles4,"Hey Spotify, As a 13-year-old with an Apple Watch set up using Family Sharing, I'm a huge fan of Spotify. However, I'm disappointed that the watch app can't function without an iPhone, and I've tried to set up a backup device using an iPhone 6s, but it's not compatible with iOS 16. I'm hoping that the developers at Spotify will consider implementing a code screen similar to the one found on Wear OS, Google's operating system. This would make a tremendous difference for me and other users, and would allow us to continue using Spotify without needing an iPhone. The implementation of such a feature would be relatively straightforward - all it would require is removing the app store requirement and adding the code screen.

The only order to play is last-in-first-out (LIFO), which is inconvenient for a thousand different reasons.

This is especially frustrating since the Spotify (+) interface encourages users to add multiple episodes of the same podcast at a time because it is too hard to add them in the reverse-order you want to play them in (requires jumping around from podcast to podcast, extra scrolling, losing your place, etc), and if the listener's play order preference ever changes, there's no way to accommodate that new preference.

Of course you could just add albums to regular playlists but then it just adds the songs separately, which is messy, so you can't easily see which or how many albums are there in the list or checking if there are missing songs. You can add and remove whole albums to collections, much like songs to playlists By having album collections we could easily see which albums are added to them and it would make it quicker to select certain albums for downloading by toggling the download button of a collection containing them. We could also re-order the list of albums quicker than re-ordering a simple playlist of consecutive albums broken down to songs. This would also make it possible to listen to certain albums in a specific or even random order without having to add every album to the queue one by one.

At this age, a podcast will likely have over 600 episodes. If you decide to listen from the beginning, you can easily sort oldest to newest and start working through them from episode 1. Now after some time, you will be 100 or 200 episodes in. Now, when you open the podcast episode list, if you sort by oldest to newest, you will have to scroll through a couple hundred episodes to get to where you're at. When you're at around 300, you will have to start at either end and scroll through 300 episodes to get to where you are. Sometimes the Spotify Android app will jump to where you last were, however this seems to happen on very rare occasions for me. Improvement:For podcasts with hundreds of episodes, the episode list should be accessible through a drop down menu or similar UI element to separate episodes through more manageable chunks of episodes. As an example, selecting ""Episodes 300-349"" from a menu makes it much more manageable to scroll through and select my next episode. As it stands, I find the UX for podcasts with more than a couple hundred episodes to be pretty painful. I encourage the UX designers go to a long-running podcast and scroll 300 episodes one or two times a day as I find myself doing to get an idea of how this can be improved with a more granular organization structure.",04:32 AM,‎2023-04-04,live,2,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Android-Podcasts-Podcast-Episode-UX/idi-p/5533479,True,Updated on 2023-04-06Hello @Crunkleburg    Thanks for submitting your idea to the Idea Exchange!   We've gone ahead and marked this as a new suggestion.

This can be super harmful if children are around or if I simply don't want to hear explicit content.

864,live,[Mobile] «After Queue» Sleeptimer Function,OleOmang,"One feature that could be added to Spotify's sleep timer is the option to stop the music after the current queue is complete. Currently, users can set a timer to stop the music after a set number of minutes or after a single track has played, but there isn't an option to automatically stop the music once the current queue of songs has finished playing.Adding this feature would be particularly helpful for users who want to listen to a few set songs before heading to sleep or just want to listen to songs in different playlists from the queue without the music stopping in the middle of a track. To implement this feature, Spotify could add a new setting to the sleep timer menu that allows users to choose whether they want the music to stop after a set number of minutes, after a single track, or after the current queue is complete. Users could simply select the desired option, set the timer, and enjoy a fee of their favourite songs before heading to sleep.",10:08 PM,‎2023-03-22,live,2,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Mobile-After-Queue-Sleeptimer-Function/idi-p/5525807,True,"Updated on 2023-04-06Hello @OleOmang,   Thanks for submitting your idea to the Idea Exchange!   We've gone ahead and marked this as a new suggestion.

867,live,[Web Player] Opening a song link should take you to the album it's from,Autoplay_is_Trash,"This entire time I have been using Spotify, there has been a very logical system. You search for a song. You click on said song. It takes you to the album (or EP or whatever) that the song is from. Now in a recent update this has been changed so that clicking a song no longer shows you where it's from, but instead shows you the song's lyrics, followed by essentially the artist's main page, and then way at the bottom is the album it's from. This is entirely redundant as clicking the name of the artist already takes you to their main page which also shows you all their popular hits. If you're clicking on a specific song name, perhaps a deep cut, then you specifically want to know that deep cut, not their most popular hits. And like I said, you already have a link anyway that does the same thing, so it's unnecessary. For lyrics, there is similarly already a button at the bottom right of the player controls which you can click on to show lyrics. We don't need multiple links that do the same thing. To make matters more confusing, if you're currently playing a song, then clicking the link of the song in the bottom left corner will take you to the album it's from, as expected. So, to reiterate, clicking a link from search results or playlists takes you to a redundant, unwanted song page, but you can click on the song name to get the response you want if you are currently playing the song. This is a terrible change. I don't care about the lyrics. If I did, I could just press the button for them. But I do want the ability to be able to explore and discover other music while I'm still listening to something else. I also want the ability to quickly and easily see what album a song is from and where it is (track number) in it. In this new system, you would have to stop whatever it is you are listening to and play something else just to see what album it's from. The end user essentially loses the ability to explore new music while still listening to their current song, in exchange for two links that do the same end result of taking you to the artist's home page and showing you their pop hits. For the Record, I am not asking for a complete rollback. I happen to think changing the ""heart"" system to a plus is a good thing. Hearts are a silly way to communicate I just want to add an album to my library. A plus is a better design. I just want to keep Spotify the way it has always been that makes discovering new music and navigating to an album really easy. If this change is here to stay, I won't be. Spotify will lose one of its key advantages as the superior music streaming platform. Here is the bottom line, Spotify. You don't need complicated recommendation algorithms and privacy-defiling data collection to help people discover new music. We discover new music from other like-minded REAL PEOPLE who have made playlists on the platform of the genre we like. We can listen to songs from these playlists, and if we like them, we then check out some of the other songs on the album it's from, and that can grow into an appreciation for the artist's other works. In other words, search is always better than recommendations. Music is inherently personal. It defines us, it is an expression of our identity. Nobody wants to be told what to listen to by an a.i. bot. We want to be allowed to explore through the search function and discover new albums and new artists for ourselves. Losing the ability to link a new favorite song directly to its album hurts Spotify's role as a middleman connecting eager fans-to-be with artists who want to be heard.",09:30 AM,‎2023-03-16,live,1,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Web-Player-Opening-a-song-link-should-take-you-to-the-album-it-s/idi-p/5521596,True,Updated on 2023-04-06Hello and thanks for submitting your idea to the Idea Exchange!   We've gone ahead and marked this as a new suggestion.

870,live,[Playlists] Remove a song from a Blend and prevent similar songs,hmthws,"I had a suggestion for the new Spotify Blends that came out for Spotify. I really like this new feature and I think Spotify has done a really good job with it! However, I listen to a genre that my friends do not like. I noticed that a lot of music of that genre appeared in my Spotify Blends even though I have other music in common with my friends that could appear instead. Right now, the only option is to 'hide the song' but that only works to hide the song from your own device. Can we have a 'remove from playlist' option for songs that we don't like in the Blend? Removing the song should ideally be permanent, and should work on the entire playlist on all devices. Also, once we remove songs from the Blend, then can it prevent similar songs/songs of that genre from appearing again in the Blend? It would be even better if right after we remove a song, it is instantly replaced by a song that is different from it like it is learning from the feedback.

872,live,[All Platforms][Playlists] Add the same song to multiple playlists simultaneously,conner_thewhite,"There is no reason why Spotify shouldn't have a functionality on at least the desktop app where you can drag one song into as many ""selected"" playlists as you want and have that song added to all of them at the same time… Here's a little more info to back up this request: I'm, for one, the kind of person who obsesses over music, and a huge component of that is the way in which I organize my playlists. I believe it is probably safe to say that most people wish their music was better organized, but the primary reason why they aren't is simply the amount of time it takes to put together quality playlists. Instead, what most people end up with are a small handful of enormous playlist hundreds, if not thousands, of songs that have no rhyme or reason to why they are in the same playlists. To avoid this dilemma, I have spent hours and hours sorting through all my favorite songs and making different types of playlists that they may fit into. One thing I learned early on is that a particular song is likely going to fit into multiple playlists, and this is where the problem lies and the primary reason why most people avoid making well thought out playlists altogether. In order to add a song to all the playlists I want, I have to sit at my computer and continuously drag a new song I want put into different playlists into each individual one over and over again which, when organizing dozens or even hundreds of songs, can take an insane amount of unnecessary time. And that is if you happen to be creating and organizing playlists on the desktop app… if you are trying to do this on your phone, you might as well forget about it - it would take you an hour to add 20 different songs to 10 different playlists. That is why I believe Spotify should add a function (starting on desktop and eventually moving onto mobile like they are likely to do with the ""folders"" for playlists) in which a single song can be added to multiple playlists at the same time.

Throughout the day I'm listening to either music (while working) OR podcasts (while commuting). If I'm commuting to work, I'd like to queue up podcasts to listen to while commuting. This includes coming back to the same podcast queue when I'm commuting home from work (ie. same queue in the morning and evening). The problem is, I listen to music during the day while I'm working. So I need to clear my podcast queue and then queue everything up again after work. I think fixing this would increase user engagement on your apps. For example, having my podcasts on Apple podcasts is just more convenient now because I don't need to deal with this daily inconvenience. Every week, that's multiple hours of engagement per user (for a subset of podcast listeners) that you could be gaining back.I'm a huge fan of Spotify, so I'd love to be able to seamlessly use your app over Apple Podcasts for this use case.

917,live,[Desktop][Friend Feed] Device Indicator on Friend Activity,kaworu_bloodpaw,"I spend most of my day listening to Spotify, and I constantly check my Friend Activity panel to see if my friends are listening or not. I do however often wonder if they are listening on Desktop or Mobile since Friend Activity doesn't exist on mobile. I think it would be cool if a device indicator was added to the Friend Activity panel for each user, something like Discord does.Spotify currently has both the blue dot next to a user's profile picture and a waveform icon when a user is listening. I think either the dot could be replaced with a phone icon when someone is listening on mobile (like Discord), or a little desktop/mobile icon could be placed next to the existing waveform icon. @Echo_The_Cute_Wolf made a mockup for me. Something kinda like this, but obviously more in Spotify's branding/design. My imagination takes me to something similar to the Connect icon. I think this spot would be a great spot for this icon, and a great addition to Friend Activity. If possible, I would like the indicator to remain even after users stop listening to Spotify, but I would be content if it didn't.

919,live,[All Platforms][Other] Romanized Lyrics for Songs Not In Latin Alphabet,amknana12,"Recently, Spotify (at least in my iOS app) has added a very helpful feature which is lyrics. It finally collaborated with Musixmatch (thanks God why haven't you done this sooner). Problem is, I am an Indonesian listener who is familiar with Latin alphabet. I loved many Asian songs, which we know, are not written in language using those Latin alphabets, namely K-Pop, J-Pop, or you name it. Those songs' lyrics are still shown in their original alphabet (K-Pop in hangeul, J-Pop in kanji and hiragana, etc). Usually, foreign listeners are able to sing-a-long by looking at the romanization version. Now I know that Musixmatch indeed does not have that romanization lyrics, but Genius does and I know Spotify has partnership too with Genius, I guess? So, why not give a choice for listeners to choose between Genius or Musixmatch? TL;DR:1. We want romanized lyrics to Asian songs or any songs not using Latin alphabet2. Give options for Spotify listeners to choose which version to show3. If Spotify can no longer show Genius' service, push Musixmatch so that they make romanized lyrics available. Sincerely,Global Spotify member. [UPDATE]A comment below notified me that Musixmatch has provided options for translations and indeed they are now shown in Spotity. I see this as a nice improvement!

926,live,[Podcasts] Subtitles for Podcasts,arebecaIuana,"Thanks for the ""karaoke"" feature that allows us to follow the lyrics of the songs. It's great for anyone learning a new language or who needs to find a specific part of a song's lyrics, and especially for deaf people who, different from what is generally expected, also like to enjoy music on Spotify and this feature makes the experience more accessible.However, a similar feature has not yet been implemented in podcasts, which is a shame as there are many creators producing extremely relevant content on the platform, but, for lack of an accessibility feature, this content doesn’t reach as many people as possible and many creators choose to make their content available on platforms that respect the diversity of their audience.By making some updates to the karaoke feature that already exists on the platform we can have a Spotify more accessible to everyone. The ideal is a tool that generates an automatic description of the spoken content, as present in other online platforms, but also allows edits to be made by the content creator itself.And then it should be automatically synchronized with the audio and available in the desktop and mobile version as well.This update will bring more people to Spotify, as many people consume podcast media looking to learn a new language and would like to be able to check words they don't understand well, in addition, browsing the synchronized caption of the content allows you to find which part of a particular episode has the information that the person is looking for.Most importantly, it will highlight the issue of accessibility for people with disabilities and initiate a dialogue with the disabled people community, because deficiencies are part of human diversity and must be respected.",07:29 PM,‎2021-05-06,live,4628,90,9,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Podcasts-Subtitles-for-Podcasts/idi-p/5200537,True,"Updated on 2021-06-15 Hey everyone,     Thanks for bringing us your feedback in the Spotify Idea Exchange.     Your suggestion has gathered the votes necessary and your feedback is now reaching the internal teams at Spotify.

947,live,[Privacy] Private Session should stay active,jakenfinn,"Let's face it. We've all used Spotify to listen to music that we would be embarassed to advertise publically. Whether it's kittens meowing Christmas songs, that your friends would never let you live down, or a hardcore rap album, that you wouldn't want your 8 year old cousin to go and listen to because his cool aunt or uncle likes it. When it comes to this social music app, privacy is not a convenient bonus feature, it's a critical necessity. Currently, the only way to listen to songs privately on Spotify, is to go to the settings and activate a private session. This is not only annoying, since I constantly have to navigate through settings to activate privacy on my phone, it's stressful because you have to worry about whether or not certain people can see what you're listening too. My primary music app should not cause anxiety about what I share publically. From a 2011 blog post ""Spotify is all about sharing and discovering new music. It’s entirely up to you what you decide to share and what you keep private."" With the first part in mind, it makes sense that spotify would default to making all of the music you listen to public to your followers but the second part is not true. Anyone can follow me on Spotify and if I have to continuously activate a private session, there will inevitably be times when I forget. As a paying customer, I should have the ability to hide what I listen to if I please and activate privacy indefinitely.",01:17 PM,‎2015-03-10,live,566,90,9,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Privacy-Private-Session-should-stay-active/idi-p/1042929,True,"Updated on 2023-03-30Hey everyone,   It seems that this idea ended up in the wrong board accidentally, so we're bringing it back.   We're keeping the previous Not Right Now status, as we don't have any immediate plans to implement this.

957,live,[Mobile] Preview albums for free users,ollylee03,"Recently, Spotify took away the ability for free users to see what songs are in an album or by a particular artist. Before, free users were able to select an album, press “preview” or “and more”, and see a list of all the songs in the album, each with a short audio demo. This made it much easier to discover new artists, and created a much more convenient user experience. The only way to hear samples of songs now is to listen through Spotify-made playlists. Unfortunately lots of smaller artists don't feature on many of these playlists making it very difficult to sample/discover their music. Obviously, I understand that as a free user there are compromises that need to be made by users like listening to ads, only being able to shuffle and not being able to listen to specific songs, but removing the ability to see what songs I'm shuffling is silly; so silly in fact that many users thought it was a glitch in the app at first.

This update doesn't actually solve the issue that the activity toggle is hard to find and unknown by a large majority of users. My suggestion is to place a toggle and indicator at the top of the 'Friend Activty' sidebar so that users can turn on and off their activty sharing with ease and be aware of their sharing status. This will not totally resolve the issue because a user will need to have the 'Friend Activity' sidebar enabled to see it to start with but it is a start to making this functionality far more accessible and obvious. An additional change would be to place a 'Share Activty with Friends' button under the 'Private Session' button in the profile dropdown menu with a green check mark to it when enabled similar to what the 'Private Session' button does when enabled. If this is done it is important to make it clear in the settings menu and possibly through hints what the difference is between enabling a private session, and disabling sharing your activity.",10:28 PM,‎2021-12-09,live,390,30,3,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Desktop-Friend-Feed-Move-Share-Activity-Toggle-to-Friend/idi-p/5312877,True,"Updated on 2022-01-06 Hey everyone,     Thanks for bringing us your feedback in the Spotify Idea Exchange.     Your suggestion has gathered the votes necessary and your feedback is now reaching the internal teams at Spotify.

984,live,"Spotify & ""Song Radio"" is Essentially Just an Echo Chamber & Doesn't Breed Discovery",cawul,"This hasn't always been the case, and I don't know if this has to do with the amount of time I've had my Spotify account or if something about the algorithm has drastically changed - but whenever I start a radio based off a song or artist (which is with the intention to find a NEW artist or NEW music that is related to the song/artist I'm starting the radio off of) it just creates essentially a playlist of music I've been listening to - and not even within the same genre off the song. I've realized that I haven't found any new artists or any new music, and just continuously listen to the same things over and over again which is quite depressing. The point of the song radio or at least how I use it is to discover new artists that are in the same realm of the artist I'm listening to, and I think you all at Spotify are putting everyone - artist AND listener - at a huge detrimental disadvantage by having it go that way because then there is no discovery for new artists and there is no way for listeners to get into new music without scouring the platform instead of giving good recommendations based off your algorithm. More than anything I want to be able to discover new artists based off song radio, not just hear the same songs I've been listening to.

However, it'd be great to mark a podcast as 'do not play again' or 'dislike' so it doesn't show up or similar podcasts don't appear. It would also like to love/like songs that appear, as well as the ability to complete skip a podcast if its something I'm less interested in. Podcast runs similar to normal podcast, but I feel that this is a different experience (and a catered one), we should have more freedom to skip/like/love/dislike to make this experience improve over time.

To the best of my knowledge, Sonos is the only 3rd party vendor to have direct access to the API from within their platform. With platforms such as Control4, the end user has too many steps and potential points of failure, prior to achieving a successful Spotify stream. Our clients in the CI (custom integration) market space, are high net worth individuals, that typically own more than one home. Spotify connect is a terrible way to bring your product to our client base. We are a Control4 dealer and we have native integration to Pandora, Sirius/XM, Tidal, Deezer, Qobuz and more. We defer to these streaming services over Spotify for ease of use and the client does not want to go through all of the additional steps and leave the Control4 App to manage their Spotify service.

999,live,[Mobile] See all Songs on Artist Page,TLuck,"Dear spotify, First of all, thanks for your awesome service! I really enjoy my premium account on my desktop and iPhone version and use it at home and wherever I go. However there's something that bothers me often while searching for a song, especially on the iPhone version. I often search for a song of a specific artist. So I use the search function and reach the artist's page. Once there, the app only shows the 5 most popular songs of the artist. But often the song I'm looking for is not listed there (maybe nr 6 on the list or lower). Now I have the option of searching through the albums, which can be quite time consuming, or try to use the search function again and hope to find it with a more specific combination of words (provided that I know anything more than the artist's name). Now every time I get to this I'm thinking why can't I tap a button ('see all songs') which allows me to see all the artist's songs in a list? That is something I'm looking for intuitively. On the desktop version, the list of 5 can be extended to 10 most popular, but also here I'm thinking: why only 10?! Actually, the list I'm looking for can be brought up by the app already by playing the first song (while not in shuffle mode) and tapping the playlist icon. This brings up the kind of list I would like to see: all the artists songs I can just browse through. Only now I'm playing the first song, which I didn't want to hear at all. Preferably, I would want to be albe to sort the list in order of popularity or alphabet.

If you change the first 4 songs, the image changes accordingly. In playlists where the song order doesn't matter, of course you place first the 4 albums you want featured in the image. But sometimes you have a playlist (like a playlist for a decade or a particular time period of your life) where you want the songs to be listed in chronological order starting with the first years. In these cases, maybe the first 4 songs are not representative of most of the playlist, so they do not give other users a good idea of it.

With Spotify, I was happy to discover that you can listen to files in the device's local storage, but I was disappointed when I realized that the songs are arranged in one long list sorted alphabetically, and not sorted by the folders I have in the local storage. It would be very nice if there will be an option to have the ""local files"" in Spotify sorted by the folders in the local storage, or even to get the local folders as playlists in my Spotify library, so I could rename the playlists and add an image (as I can do with regular playlists today).

1043,live,Managing Duplicates Of Releases,Jua-537s,"The result of a re-upload of an album, an EP, a single, or a collection can sometimes cause there to be duplicates of the same release. while sometimes the difference is the inclusion/exclusion of singles in an album or a collection, in most cases it is the exact same release down to the waveform. This leads to a few problems. 1- Users unknowingly saving the same songs or albums more than once.2- Being unable to find a specific release when looking for it.Options For Fixes 1:It has been mentioned on a separate thread that newly uploaded releases should be overriding old releases, and when going into an older one the URL should redirect to the newer upload of that same release. While in most cases that does seem to be the case, sometimes that doesn't work. Perhaps the uploader (artist) is doing something incorrectly, in which case they need to be educated and explained this. 2:I think the best option to keep track of different releases is having an identifier- just like every other medium has a specific identifier, whether an LP, a CD, a cassette, or anything else; every single pressing and master has a unique ID. Spotify doesn't keep track of albums this way. I think it would make a lot of sense to have an ID value for each unique release available on Spotify. Another option is having the ability to search using URLs. With each release having a unique URL this can act similarly to having an ID. EXAMPLES: In Between Dreams by Jack Johnson- While not a duplicate, one of the versions has an extra track- ""Constellations - Demo Version"". This is the most easily accessed one when searching. The other release has the same tracks but does not feature the extra track. Brothers In Arms by Dire Straits- There are 2 identical versions of this that I'm aware of. Soul Mining by The The- This is a great example of how it should be, having a dropdown menu at the bottom (PC app) and the ability to select each of the 4 releases. This particular example is more obvious since it has different covers in different counties.* It should be noted that the only way I am able to find these different releases is that I saved them before they became harder to find.",10:31 PM,‎2023-03-20,live,2,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Managing-Duplicates-Of-Releases/idi-p/5524369,True,"Updated on 2023-03-22Hello @Jua-537s,   Thanks for submitting your idea to the Idea Exchange!   We've gone ahead and marked this as a new suggestion.

1067,live,[Social] Rooms/Shared Listening Concept,marcdreizehn,"Hello there! I know this idea has been brought up before, but all those ideas were several years ago by now, and I couldn't find a recent discussion about this. Imagine having ""rooms"" within Spotify, where you can listen together, simultaneously, to the same track with everybody else in the room, no matter where in the world they are, and no matter what device they're using. You can step up and join the DJ queue, and all DJs in the room play one track, one after another. The friend feed on the right side turns into a chatbox, and you can communicate and talk about music while listening to the same tracks. Think tuntable.fm, plug.dj, jqbx.fm, ... but right inside Spotify! Check out this Medium article by Austin Condiff I found today, detailing this concept (following mockup taken from that article). I've been hoping to have some social aspect like this within Spotify, and I think this would enrich the community even further. You could create rooms based on genres or moods, and enjoy music together with friends and strangers alike. An upvote/downvote function would keep rooms democratic and true to their respective themes. The mentioned article perfectly explains the concept and benefits of this feature, please check it out!

1069,live,[Other] Location-based music suggestions,GoodIdeasMan,"Dear Spotify Feedback Team,I am writing to share an exciting idea for a new feature that could revolutionize the way users experience music on your platform. The idea is to introduce location-based music suggestions, which would allow users to enjoy customized music experiences that reflect their current location and environment.The location-based music suggestions feature would use geolocation data to detect the user's location and suggest playlists or tracks that are tailored to the environment. For example, if the user is at the beach, Spotify could suggest playlists with beach-themed music, while if the user is in a forest, Spotify could suggest playlists with more relaxing or natural sounds. The music would change dynamically based on the user's location, seamlessly transitioning from one playlist to another as the user moves from one environment to another.The feature could also include curated musical regions, which would showcase the unique musical cultures of different regions and locations. These curated playlists could be created in collaboration with local artists, music historians, or tourism boards, and would allow users to discover new music and cultural experiences that are specific to each location.We believe that the location-based music suggestions feature would be a great addition to the Spotify platform, providing users with a personalized and engaging music experience that is tailored to their current location and environment. This feature could be particularly useful for travelers or those exploring new regions, but could also be a great way for anyone to discover new music experiences that are unique to their local area.Thank you for considering this idea. We believe that it has great potential to enhance the user experience on the Spotify platform and we look forward to seeing it come to life.",03:57 PM,‎2023-03-16,live,3,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Other-Location-based-music-suggestions/idi-p/5521894,True,"Updated on 2023-03-19Hello @GoodIdeasMan,   Thanks for submitting your idea to the Idea Exchange!   We've gone ahead and marked this as a new suggestion.

1076,live,[Playlists] Smart Playlists (Nested),SuperSpasm,"A smart playlist consists of other playlists, as one big joined playlist - it can be played in sequence or shuffled.

NOTE: This is not accomplished by playlist folders! See below. Benefits over playlist foldersPlaylist Reuse: Any number of smart playlists can share a playlist! whereas only one folder can contain a the same playlist.This will allow having smaller, ""atomic"" playlists as building blocks of larger ones.Example: Below ""Oldies"" is shared / reused by different smart playlists:Easy morning [smart] = (Oldies -> Chill) Nostalgia [smart] = (Oldies -> 90's -> Specific songs)Sharing (A) - This could encourage playlist creators to make more nuanced playlists, as they will have a tool to compose more of them out of parts, instead of investing in a single large one, or copy-pasting like crazy.Sharing (B) - This could also open up an entire new content eco-system for compiling other creator's playlists, and re-sharing them as a new whole.Easy ""temp"" playlists - Currently, to combinine playlists for a party, drive, etc- you must break your organizational hierarchy to create a folder.This causes a mess to be cleaned later.Having a single ""temp"" smart playlist would allow you to change it's contents on the fly, without messing up your playlist organization.I have more ideas, but I'll add them as a reply so this is more readable 🙂 I realize this is not a small feature - but for a few years I've felt It's absence, and I really believe this could be a game changer - if done properly.

1083,live,[Mobile][Other] Volume Intervals,colecody27,"Idea This idea would implement functionality to assist with workouts or other tasks that require keeping track of time intervals. This would allow the user to create one or more intervals that alternate the volume between high and low after a specified period of time. Both volumes and durations will be set by the user. This would prevent the user from having to utilize an additional application that uses an obnoxious noise which could break user concentration or interrupt the flow of music, or continuously referencing a clock or timer. This functionality not only assist with the time intervals but would also provide users with an increase in volume when they are in need of ""extra motivation"" for instance. For example: Take for instance, running intervals on a treadmill. This user wants to run for 1 minute and walk for 2 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. The user would create an interval with a ""high"" and ""low"" volume. Let's say low is set to 25%, high is set to 50%. The user would then input the duration for both volumes which in this case will be: low set to 2 minutes, high set to 1 minutes. Once the user begins their music, this interval will begin, alternating between the two defined volumes notifying the user when to walk and run until the end of the 30 minutes.",11:37 PM,‎2023-03-14,live,3,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Mobile-Other-Volume-Intervals/idi-p/5520732,True,"Updated on 2023-03-16Hello @colecody27,   Thanks for submitting your idea to the Idea Exchange!   We've gone ahead and marked this as a new suggestion.

Clearly if you will listen to a whole audiobooks its time consuming and therefore most definitley exceed your real music stats. This is sad and always cracks me up at the end of the year because I will never truly know which artist/album truly would have taken the audiobooks place...I, therefore, suggets to either exclude audiobooks (through their category) fully from spotify wrapped or do an additional wrapped page only for audiobooks like the podcasts one.

1118,live,[Mobile][Browse] Multiple playback queues,jtjr,"With Spotify’s push into podcasts I am routinely switching between music and podcasts. This means constantly losing my place in a given playlist or having to navigate back to podcast episode I was mid way through. Having the option to have multiple players, with their own queue and controls would eliminate this back and forth problem. Idea: long pressing a song, album or podcast should allow the user to “open in new player+”. This would pause the current player and begin playing the selected media in a seperate player. The user would now see two seperate players at the bottom of the screen. Anything the user queues will be added to the top player (which is the currently playing or last played). User can switch the play order by dragging the player position to the top or close a player by swiping to delete (basic iOS list functionality).",03:45 AM,‎2023-01-25,live,279,30,3,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Mobile-Browse-Multiple-playback-queues/idi-p/5493900,True,Updated on 2023-02-01Hey!

1140,live,[Your Library] Bring back 'hold to preview song' button,rossmillen21,"A few years ago Spotify had a feature that allowed you to hold down on a song and it would give a 10-15 second sample of the song. I used to discover so many new/different artists as it gave me a chance to preview a song before committing to listening to the full thing. It was later removed (I think in 2016?) and I enquired at the time and they said it was so they could implement another feature in the app using the hold down feature.

1141,live,[All Platforms][Discover] Setting to prefer original (explicit) content over clean alternatives,muldrr,"IssueWhile listening to music, especially when listening to through Autoplay after an album, through Discover, Daily Mixes or automatically generated playlists, Spotify often plays the ""clean"" edits of songs that have their original version tagged as explicit.The option ""Allow playback of explicit-rated content"" is there for people who don't want explicit content, but the behavior of this option is not ideal for people who have it enabled.If an explicit version of a song exists, I do not want to hear the censored, chopped up version with often mangled lyrics. I want to hear the original song as the artist intended it. In my opinion the clean version is nearly always inferior to the original.Currently it seems like the use-case of people who want to hide explicit music is valued higher than the use-case for people who want to listen to the original. I would argue that we should be treated at least equally. ExampleWhat got me here today was while listening to ""Ten thousand hours"" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, and hearing ""Make sure the soundman doesn't block-block the drums"" and hearing frequent ""Shht""'s really breaks the flow of the track.What especially triggered me, is that it showed that I had ""hearted""/liked the song. I did like the original version, and it occurs in multiple playlists of mine. The clean version does not.Note that this is not a complaint about this song in particular, it is just an example that occurred today. Proposed solutionIf the ""Allow playback of explicit-rated content"" option is ticked, the ""clean"" content is very likely of no value to the user, and should never be favored over the original version.If you do not want to force this behavior to the entire userbase, or change existing behavior for existing users, then an option could be to add an extra opt-in setting to ""Block playback of clean edits when original is available"" or something similar. So basically the exact opposite of the currently already implemented ""Allow playback of explicit-rated content"" is desired: never allow clean edits.Your team might well come up with a different, perhaps better solution, but the end goal would be to never have to listen to a ""clean"" version again when the original is available. Previous submissions and discussionsMany ideas have been submitted before, they are however all closed, marked as duplicate, marked as ""unclear"" or found to have not enough votes.This new submission is an attempt to combine all previous efforts and hopefully get some traction.While not all of the options discussed below are exactly the same, they are all about this topic and they all suggest some way of playing the original over the clean edit.If you see all the previous topics in the table below (there are probably others that I might have missed), it is clear that this is a frequently brought up topic in the community.Hopefully listing them here helps people find this feature request.

1147,live,"[Playlists] Expand ""Discovered On"" User-Generated Playlists on Artist Profiles to Show On Mobile",outtallectuals,"BackgroundEarlier this year with Spotify's UI change, user-generated playlists (UGP) were removed from artist profiles, before subsequently returning on desktop (with some expansion to now show 50 playlists when pressing 'See All'). Despite the initial scare, it was nice to see that Discovered On made *some* come-back, but it needs more. It's currently unfair that Spotify only shows its own playlists on Mobile, completely removing visibility on UGP.In fact, with Spotify's recent streamlining of Web/Mobile/Desktop App UIs to all look and function similarly, this new addition shouldn't be difficult at all. If anything, I imagine Spotify is actively omitting Discovered On from artist profiles on mobile now (You can see this in the A/B difference attached, between the Mobile & Narrow Desktop App window view, which are practically the same, except the omission of Discovered On).I'm requesting for Discovered On to show on Mobile as it does on Desktop, so that:- Listeners can tap into the huge world of user-curated playlists to find similar artists. - Independent curators (labels, bloggers, influencers, etc.) can still have visibility for their playlists, and not drown in an overly monopolized Spotify environment.- Artists can also obviously enjoy getting more discovery and visibility through a largely available yet untapped resource, especially artists who DEPEND on third party curators, i.e. those not picked up by Spotify algorithms and editorials which are arguably most artists on the platform.How To Achieve This:It's very simple. Below the Featuring, Fans Also Like, Appears On & Artist Playlists widget/tabs, just show Discovered On tab as is shown on Desktop.

1154,live,[Android] Support USB Audio directly - bypassing the Android Driver,ZorkII,"USB DAC/amps are less impressive on Android Spotify because the standard Android driver is up-sampling. The Dragonfly Red runs at 44.1kHz with Spotify on my PC but on Android it up-samples to 96kHz causing glitching. Other DACs have similar issues. The proposal is for Spotify to access USB DACs directly, bypassing the Android driver. Audiophile music players already take this approach, e.g. USB Audio Player PRO (UAPP) and Neutron. Tidal works with UAPP. This idea is a version of ""Support USB Audio through the USB Audio Player PRO driver"" without the 3rd party partnership. It was written in response to @meahtenoha's review. Both ideas originate from the USB audio out OTG support thread. External USB headphone DAC/amps for Android phones are becoming a thing. What Hi-Fi has a Best DACs page that mainly lists portable audiophile kit. I would prefer to carry a phone and a DAC rather than a phone and a portable music player because it is more fun to have access to the whole Spotify catalogue.",11:06 AM,‎2017-03-12,live,812,60,6,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Android-Support-USB-Audio-directly-bypassing-the-Android-Driver/idi-p/1607461,True,"Updated on 2019-09-18Hey folks,     Thanks for coming to the Community, and adding your vote to this idea!     We're setting this idea to 'Not Right Now', as this isn't something we have any immediate plans to implement.

1180,live,[Playlists] Additive & Subtractive Playlists,neilforreal,"Additive & Subtractive Playlists are an idea I had the other day. I was listening to my February playlist and realized that I like the songs I have on there, but if I want to play that playlist at night, there are some songs I'd like to leave out (I love the riff of Nefi + Girly, but it's not something I'd fall asleep to). Hence the idea of additive playlists and subtractive playlists. This will consist of one pair of two playlists. One will have the full array of songs -- the additive -- and one will have that array minus the ones you take out -- the subtractive. On the diagram below, 1 is the additive playlist and 2 is the subtractive (For my example, you could think of 1 as February and 2 as February Night). When I add a playlist to February, it goes into February Night as well. And when I add a song to February Night, it also goes into February (blue arrows). But when I remove a song from February, I don't want it anywhere; it's removed from both. If I remove a song from February Night, it's only removed from the one (red arrows). In execution, I could see the user right-clicking a playlist and selecting create subtractive playlist, producing a pair of playlists, additive and subtractive.",03:57 AM,‎2023-02-02,live,2,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Playlists-Additive-amp-Subtractive-Playlists/idi-p/5498343,True,Updated on 2023-02-03Hello and thanks for bringing your feedback to the Idea Exchange.

1191,live,[iOS][Other] Faster Queueing Via Firm Hold,OwenTheGroovy,"As seen in the YouTube-based music app Musi (my example, I’m sure that there are others), there’s a feature that allows a firm/ non-moving hold of a finger on the title of any song to give a light click vibration and instantly add the song to the ‘end of the line’ in the user’s current queue. In contrast, the current way of queueing in Spotify requires two clicks and a second-long waiting period after queueing a song before they’re able to continue with their browsing. There is no current use of the ‘hold down action’; if the user holds down on a song it already disrupts their viewing ability, meaning that most should understand/ be comfortable/ used to not doing so. This means that the spot is open, an unused space for a better quality of a listening experience with Spotify. - Listed category is put as other since this could/ should be able to be done to any song, by search OR in a playlist (both)",03:09 AM,‎2023-01-30,live,0,10,1,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/iOS-Other-Faster-Queueing-Via-Firm-Hold/idi-p/5496404,True,Updated on 2023-02-03Hello and thanks for bringing your feedback to the Idea Exchange.

But not like a whole menu of videogames to play. That would take the focus away from the music. What I'm suggesting is alongside canvas's, give artists the opportunity to submit simple interactions or games that the listener can participate in in order to connect with the music and art more and enrich their experience. It allows the artist to immerse the listener even further into their song and fully bring out their vision. The games don't have to be like an entire mobile game or even a game at all. It could be a simple slide/button click to unlock/open up a second canvas or something like the Yeezy Gap Game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-euzeXlHJVM (this is more of what I envision, but even more simpler, like pixelated or just easier to make).

This is important as desktop Spotify has a very low contrast GUI, with no high contrast setting options.Other voice-activated virtual assistants (Bixby, Cortana, etc.).

1215,live,[Playlists] Shuffle+ A new shuffling method,Haisom,"Hello everyone! Ever wondered why everyone is still stuck on same old Shuffle? Whether is shuffling non heard songs properly or is just completely Random, it's still always the same. How about improving this tech a little bit? This idea was already posted once through this link: https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Music-Supreme-Shuffle-among-artists-albums-etc/idc-p/4...However, it didn't get enough kudos per year, but I'm ready to try again and be more engaging with the community that share same expectations from Spotify. Shuffle+ is all about listening all your favorite songs in the most diverse order you never thought would be possible. ""How?"" you may ask. Simple. Instead of being a random shuffle, or true shuffle, Shuffle+ would works as a filter check where you can choose what to Shuffle or not. Example 1: Imagine my standard Favorite playlist from Spotify is already ordered by Album. So every time you play it, it will always play the same songs in the very same order. From album to album, alphabetically. However, I'm feeling like listening to them on a different order, but still want to enjoy whole albums or artists separately instead of shuffling through musical genres. So, you would do this: [ ] Artist [x] Album [ ] Track [ ] Genre Then hit play! What would this do? Spotify would only Shuffle+ among albums until that artist's albums in your favorite playlist are over, then, it would play tracks in order from the next artist's albums with similar genre, because only album was checked . For this to work they would need to add a new Column on library just for Genres. If not, we would only be able to shuffle among artist, album and tracks, though, with random genres. Example 2: [x] Artist [ ] Album [x] Track [ ] Genre This would make Spotify play a artist's whole tracks in shuffle mode, independent of albums, meaning albums order would be random, but all his songs would be played, no matter what. Then, would go to the next Artist and repeat it to that artist, and so on. Example 3: [ ] Artist [x] Album [ ] Track [x] Genre This one would make Spotify Shuffle among Albums and Genres, don't minding Artist or Track order. Once one Album from one Genre finished, it would play the next Album in the next Genre. If Genre is not implemented by Spotify, then it would be like example 1. Example 4: [x] Artist [x] Album [x] Track [x] Genre This would work just like usual Shuffle. Example 5: [x] Artist [x] Album [ ] Track [ ] Genre This would play one artist album in proper tracks order, then Shuffle to another artist's album and repeat. REMINDER: Always remember that whenever Shuffle+ is active, only what is selected will shuffle. Unselected items should play in proper order. Now... How would that look like? Just like the 'Loop' option alternates among 'Loop All', 'Loop One', and 'Loop Off', the 'Shuffle' button could alternate the same among 'Shuffle', 'Shuffle+', and 'Shuffle Off'.The concept of the ""check boxes"" to select what would be included in shuffle could be done by touch/holding 'Shuffle' on media player button to open up the 'Shuffle+' menu, where the main/first option would be 'On/Off', then the second would have the ""tags/checkboxes"" to pick what you want to shuffle. Doing so would save that as you preset for Shuffle+, always using it whenever you're cycling among Shuffle option. This means if the user wants to change how his Shuffle+ shuffles through content, he would have to open that menu. Hope you all get the idea. If you don't, please say in the comments and I will try to make it clearer. PS: Not intended for Liked playlist only or Freemium users. Since this is a really complex shuffle method, would only apply to Premium and would apply to all available platforms if possible. Please! Comment bellow what are your thoughts, what could be improved, if you liked it or not. I will update the idea as we get more opinions about it so we can improve it together. HELP SHARING THE WORD! =D -----CHANGELOG----- *Update 08/23/2021 - Fixed example 3 as I got confused with the explanation. Before even though Genre was checked, it was not being shuffled in the example as it should be with anything that is checked on Shuffle+ filter - Added examples 4 and 5 - Fixed a few sintax errors *Update 07/18/2021 -Added a little capped observation that maybe wasn't so clear -Added changelog section to the bottom with all updates/edits so far *Update 06/14/2021 -Added 1 extra example with album and genre- -Added how it it would look and deepened on simplified toggle on/off- -Mixed both PSs together-",06:55 PM,‎2021-05-28,live,210,20,2,https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Playlists-Shuffle-A-new-shuffling-method/idi-p/5213625,True,Updated on 2022-06-24Hey!

1229,live,"[All Platforms] Shuffle algorithm that favours ""unpopular"" songs",fraktalisman,"As a paying Spotify premium customer, I need a shuffle algorithm different from the current, non-random shuffle that seems to favor ""popular"" songs, as has been pointed out by other customers who experimented with what is actually happening (see links to other posts below).Currently there are only two possible ways to listen to music in playlists, either in the listed order, or shuffled by an algorithm that makes listeners miss out on about 20% to 30% of the songs in the list, favoring the ones that we already listened to hundreds or thousands of times.I want to be able to choose another algorithm that does exactly the opposite: play songs in a pseudo-random order but leaving out the ones that already have been played frequently, and instead focusing on songs seldom listened to, in order to make me rediscover new songs and inspirations! This is even more important when listening to playlists made by other people, to help me discover new music.The new algorithm could be called something like ""serendipity shuffle"" or ""discover mode"". This could be an option to activate in the user's settings, so the existing popularity shuffle would stay the default option.In case a serendipity shuffle is too hard for you to implement, a simple randomized shuffle function would also be much better than the current one.

1232,live,[Daily Mix] Customization: Create / Remove / Add / Merge Mixes,user-removed,"Daily Mixes is one of the best additions to Spotify yet, but as all new features it has room for a lot of improvement, especially when it comes to customizing your mixes. Right now mixes are enterily dependent on algorithms, however I think users should have a degree of personal input on how mixes are built. For example, it would be great if users could select a couple of songs and then have Spotify create a mix based on those songs. It would also be great if users could remove a mix and replace it with another, or merge different mixes into one. For example, Spotify created two different EDM mixes for me, one based on house music, and another based on tech house tracks. I find that a little redundant and I would like to merge both mixes into one. There's also another mix which is a weird combination of ambient, IDM, downtempo and indie rock tracks (?). I would like to split that mix in two, one for indie rock and another for IDM, downtempo and ambient music. And then there's a pop/R&B mix which I'd like to replace entirely with a jazz music mix, since I don't listen to that much mainstream pop and R&B music in the first place. Expanding the number of daily mixes to 8 would be great as well, since 6 mixes doesn't quite cover the variety of music I tend to listen to.

Listeners could use the feature for new popular music, news, and talk entertainment. Similar to the way the feature currently works, listeners could save their favorite stations, and browse through lists organized by genre, location, or amplitude/frequency.

1255,live,[Android][Other] Modernize app icon to support Android 13 Material You device theming,Andrewcpu,"Android 13 has introduced the required API to theme app icons based on user color themes. The Spotify app is a perfect candidate for this style of theming given the fact it's a simple icon that can be colored and themed independently from the actual shape of the icon. The implantation of the themed icon is relatively simple for a developer and would only require at MOST 3 hours of work for infinite benefit to users. The actual change in reality is setting a simple XML flag and pointing to the monochrome logo. There's a list of apps which are adding support for this feature here: https://9to5google.com/2022/08/27/android-13-themed-icons/ It's a good plan to add it soon because currently users consider the Spotify app icon because it's an eye sore compared to other themed app icons.

It would be good to have the option to 'Add all songs to playlist' from an existing created playlist to a new created playlist.For example: I have a 'notable songs' playlist for each year. I've been doing this since 2016. If I wanted to have all my favorite songs from the last 5 years in one playlist, it would be really easy to create a 'notable 2016-current' playlist by adding all the existing songs from each year's playlist together. The only option right now is to add each individual song from each year's playlist using the 'Add to playlist' option. That's the difference of 6 clicks and about 600 clicks. Would be helpful.

1286,live,[Oculus][Other] Spotify for Oculus Rift & Quest VR Platform,DJ-MastaJ,"It would be really cool to have two of my favourite things for entertainment join forces....... My Oculus Quest (or Rift) and Spotify. It would give users the very unique ability to see Spotify in such a different way and have access to their library and playlists in a whole new amazing way. That would make it enjoyable to manage, listen to and curate playlists. Not only that, it would then give users the ability to link Spotify to certain apps and games within Oculus allowing them to stream Spotify music while playing games or apps in VR. With a surround sound experience to accompany amazing visual content. Virtual Reality Oculus is amazing and it's made by Facebook, I could only imagine what could be possible if Spotify was to integrate also.... There is also an app called Tribe which is an amazing DJing VR app, there is even potential to pay a special membership for using Spotify for Oculus and being able to use the songs on the virtual decks only while using VR as to not infringe copyrights etc etc. I think there is so much potential in this especially in these down dark times of Coronavirus where we are all stuck at home in lockdowns etc. And are turning to VR or remote platform to work, live play and entertain ourselves and our families while at home.

1318,live,Redistribute Spotify on Linux Distributions,NicoHood,"Dear Spotify Team,my name is NicoHood and I am an official ArchLinux Trusted User. This means I maintain some packages in the official [community] repository [1]. I am also able to move packages from the ArchLinux User Repository (AUR)[2] into [community] if the packages are popular enough (>10 votes). As you can imagine spotify is really popular on ArchLinux with more than 1100 votes on AUR[3]. Me and the community would love to have spotify in our official repositories to provide our users a simpler channel of installing Spotify on ArchLinux. The problem we face is that the Terms of Use forbid us to redistribute Spotify. We'd require an official statement that ArchLinux is allowed to package Spotify in its repositories. I've already contacted Brendan Marsh (Product Owner, Desktop) about this topic via email without any further response. It would be nice if you can give the linux community a better channel for installing Spotify on non-debian systems. Furthermore we then can cooperate and optimize spotify for ArchLinux (e.g. using more shared libraries, providing gpg signed tarballs and https downloads etc). Me and the community hope to get some positive feedback. Thanks for taking the time. Please upvote this post if you also with to natively install Spotify on ArchLinux and other Linux Systems.
